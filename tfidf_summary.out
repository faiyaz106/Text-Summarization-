3     Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say.The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin.In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time.Because money also walks.Where Europe should hold fire though is trade.Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake.No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.

10     One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured).A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus.Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map.Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality.And Greenland also looks of comparable size.But in reality Africa is larger than both.Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world.The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623.Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head .created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine .To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda.Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period.There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and 'less important' regions get ignored.The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest.And Greenland also looks of comparable size .He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes.

14     It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress.These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business.Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company.If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain "operational headquarters" in Minneapolis, where the company is currently based.In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign.Walgreen, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland.Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills.This did not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business.But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true.Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments.They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible.There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, but we can't afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge.If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.

323     If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously.Instead of looking compassionate, he came across as foolish, opportunistic and embarrassed.For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing.The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all.If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do.I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life.Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison.What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose.The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid.The initiative was widely adopted here and abroad, transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness.I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work.The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster.Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity.Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend.They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here.But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses.But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack.It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security.This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach.Are social services and the police investigating?And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents?For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison.

333     But now one engineer has filmed spaghetti fracturing at 250,000 frames per second (fps) to explain why this happens.The YouTube star found that vibrations do not cause the spaghetti to shatter - as previously suggested.It seems that the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting of the pasta .This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent.If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ.Generally, rods - such as a pencil - eventually break into two if they are bent.This happens when the top of the rod exceeds the maximum allowable tensile stress, which is the state of stress that leads to expansion.So the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting .This means that he thought an elevation in energy levels at a molecular or atomic level was to blame.But, upon testing this theory under water to dampen the vibration, the spaghetti still broke in the same way - discounting this theory.Since his efforts, some physicists and mathematicians have worked to solve the mystery.They applied a mathematical calculation called the Kirchoff equation, which explains how waves travel through an object that's under stress.This causes a wave to travel down the remaining strand of spaghetti before it can relax and un-twist.'It's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out but it can't overcome its own mass,’ he explained in the video.His video confirms the work by the physicists at Marie Curie University.

344     Among those voting "nay" was the young Abraham Lincoln.In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote.Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834.Nobody was much shocked by these omissions.Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday.The federal government took until 1870 to follow.Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly "seasonal."One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays.Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations.Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences.Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath.Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition.Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course.They mean, "Christmas as it was when I was young."That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus.It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about "the war on Christmas."The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.

346     (CNN) -- The "conservagencia" is starting to give Jon Huntsman a second look.But the stirrings of respect may be too little, too late.RINO hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the Republican Party.Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann.All this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times.Forget that he was the one candidate with real-world foreign policy experience.He was an apostate in a cult-like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty.It seemed to say more about the current makeup of the Republican Party than it did about Jon Huntsman.And now, all of a sudden, the Utah governor has started to get some respect."And I'm afraid we've elevated style to such a degree that it's clouding our view of what is conservative."He is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them.He has better foreign policy experience than either of them.Huntsman should be a conservative hero in this race."Huntsman's position on foreign policy is the most conservative.Jon Huntsman is putting all his chips on New Hampshire, where he's been inching forward in the polls.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.

347     The word "natural" was critical.Simply being born naturally created rights and duties.Politics: Who is eligible to run for president?But did that make him a natural born citizen?Therefore, the English concept does not translate directly to the American context.Instead, the question is who is a natural member of the political community.This argument seems wrong to most scholars.But whatever its merits, it is not likely to be tested in court.Judges appropriately hesitate to overrule the democratic process.Other candidates are not likely to sue, but rather will focus on trying to win the election.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel "Jack" Chin.

359     'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said.I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.'After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement.Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris.Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue.When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person.The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for.Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation.Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards.The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents.The charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person's hands, the audit found.‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important.‘Despite the severity of their errors, CAI is worth saving.’ Mortenson was permanently removed as CAI's executive director in November, 2012.Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery.Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath .Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book.Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children.
