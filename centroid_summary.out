3     Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say.The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin.In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time.Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action.Because money also walks.As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides.Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin.Where Europe should hold fire though is trade.Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake.It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc.No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.

10     Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland.But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska.A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus.Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size.Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map.The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together.While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true.Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality.For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa.And Greenland also looks of comparable size.But in reality Africa is larger than both.As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world.Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world.The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623.The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands .The Werner heart-shaped project of the world (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world.Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head .created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine .To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda.The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands.The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map .The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest.To counter this, brilliant designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda.In the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa.And Greenland also looks of comparable size .He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes.

14     It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress.Now that corporate giants such as Pfizer, Walgreen, Medtronic and Mylan have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, Congress may finally act.These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business.Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company.In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign.Walgreen, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland.Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills.Corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders.This did not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business.Defenders of corporate inversions often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate.Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here.But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true.Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments.If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.

23     Last updated at 3:31 PM on 19th July 2011 .The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states.That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000.Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years .As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state.In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said.New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population.New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago.Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000.Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago.That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.'Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century.'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.'That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive.Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.New York, New York: Map shows new Amish communities in The Empire State .

33     These days we pick up a packet of frozen prawns from the supermarket almost without thinking.Nothing, I’m afraid, could be further from the truth.Intensively farmed: Jumbo tiger prawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the prawn farms .As an environmental journalist, I’ve visited Thailand, the world’s leading exporter of farmed king prawns, many times to investigate the prawn trade, and what I discovered is so horrifying I will never eat another king prawn again.Every aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the prawn farms that pollute the oceans.Welcome to the rotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the prawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the so-called ‘trash fish’ on which the prawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake.The damage to our oceans is also devastating.Watching a haul of trash fish being .juvenile sea creatures: crabs, starfish, sponges and small fish that .will not get the chance to grow any bigger.'Horrifying': Jim Wickens says that now he has seen Thailand's king prawn trade first hand, he will never eat a one again .It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats.My technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one.More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to ‘rescue’ me.From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grisly industry operates at first hand.Many of these boats do have ice-controlled holds, but they are reserved for commercially valuable catches.The trash fish go straight into a filthy compartment where, with boats often at sea for days at a time, they soon start to rot.Putrid: The king prawns are fed on 'trash fish' It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trucks arrive.Transformed into pellets, this is then driven to the prawn farms that have all but destroyed Thailand’s mangrove forests.Today, however, most of these forests are gone.The trade is worth £450 million in Britain alone.But prawns also need feeding — a lot of feeding.I watched from the side of one prawn pond as they prepared to harvest the fattened prawns.The sluices were opened and the prawns caught in a filter as the water drained out.But what are the alternatives to industrially produced prawns?King prawns can also be produced organically.Naturally, this makes them very expensive for supermarket customers.As consumers, however, we can look elsewhere.Dublin Bay prawns from the Irish Sea  — most of which are currently exported to France as langoustine — are another alternative.Neither, however, is currently available as cheaply or conveniently as Thailand’s tiger prawns.The only answer, I believe, is to stop eating warm-water king prawns altogether.I, for one, don’t want slave labour and the destruction of the ocean mixed in with my prawn cocktail.

36     That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four-and-a-half years ago I was like most Americans and didn't know about the Paralympics.Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching?Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person.I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life.How many households are aware of the Paralympics?The media coverage was totally different there.So it is a weird feeling being back home.Four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over.I trained for four-and-a-half years and it is already over.I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 Games.I will be honest, coming home from London isn't what I expected it to be.That medal represents more than just a winning performance.In life we all make plans.I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are.Life doesn't go according to a plan.We can map it out, we can plan it, we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own.My life this past month had a plan of its own.When the day came to a close the plan I had envisioned wasn't the plan that life had for me.As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do different next time.I have also found myself settling back into life.When I was in London we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village.We were away from the real world in many ways.We didn't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was.But then we return home and real life hits.

37     Dyson told CNN he wants the patent system in Europe radically overhauled.Over the last four decades, Dyson said, he has been affected enormously by people copying his ideas.Government leaders are continuously telling businesses that innovation drives the economy.Problems can arise because of the wording of the patents, Dyson said."There are no diagrams or drawings and often something hinges on the particular phrasing of the patent.""There shouldn't be this endless rigmarole of 'could this have been devised by one skilled in the art?'""You have to file in each country, you have to translate in each country, sue in each country, renews in each country -- it's seen as a profit center for each country."CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this story.

38     "I'll look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because the system wasn't strong enough to beat him," McQuaid told CNN ahead of the start of the Tour."It wasn't a question of authorities, because many authorities tried to catch him and weren't able to, so I don't blame the UCI.I don't blame the AFLD (French anti-doping agency) or USADA or anyone else."The system wasn't strong enough and they were using products that couldn't be caught with the system."The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it's not just Lance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it."However McQuaid's position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him.When pushed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: "No."I think he (Armstrong) was tested 10-15 times during the Tour de France.Those samples were sent away and they came back negative."The UCI wasn't the only anti-doping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong."I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn't strong enough and it wasn't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better."The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraption which is used to analyze blood samples.It is a decision which McQuaid concedes should not have been made."But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to."Cookson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization."Nobody is silly enough to say that you're 100% confident that the peleton is 100% clean," added the UCI president."I don't think it'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats."There are people who look for a short-cut, who try to win by devious means or whatever.There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though -- a route which involves Armstrong."He certainly has more knowledge," he said of Armstrong.

49     (CNN) -- My mom was always sports mad -- my dad not so much.I got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom.I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little.Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again.They were right; I would next see these two teams play as a 17-year-old.I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was.We returned a couple of years later to watch my first "Test" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies.I remember the hype and the excitement about this special day.I don't remember much about the games -- I remember more about the players.Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islanders from far, far away on our shores.I don't think most kids did -- they were just cricketers.At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph.I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great bowler.I realize the significance of that event now.Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can?Perhaps our parents would have flipped out, but this wasn't about color to us.Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were.That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too.It's all about what side of the line you were sitting, I guess.I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them.Did we look after them well enough after the fact?These men didn't deserve it, no matter what choices they made.It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return.I got to see "real" international cricket played at the "highest" level.I got to meet new cricketing greats.Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles.Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches.They must have been scared -- really scared.I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to South Africa.In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that.I remember asking my mom how that worked.She didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing.I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary.And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that "The Cosby Show" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything."Branded a rebel" showed balanced reporting.I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well.

56     The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings.According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region.There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency.The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency.However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis.Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller.""These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller," the NTSB said.Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions."The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention," the board said."Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188."Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said.The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change."Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact," the safety board said.Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said.Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt.A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing.

99     It used to be a lot easier to define threats.It's not that our dialogue has evolved much.The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media.Suppose I promise that "when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of cops dyin.'"If I tweeted that today, I might expect police at my door.People then were offended, of course.But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today.That's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers reading some guy's rabid musings on Twitter.So, threatening speech online is not about how viral or far-reaching it is.Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authored by the speaker alone.In that sense they feel more like the unfiltered statements of present intent.As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it's time to draw the line at social media.Then again, I'm biased in a way that perhaps the justices are not.The NYPD confronts a similar problem.Even if they do, by then the kids will be onto the next thing anyway .

132     It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must.I am an African-American male and I am privileged.As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed.I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots.An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others .On confronting our history he said: ."To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul.... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. "They were both right; but they were addressing two different things.Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions.Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions.Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made.And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm.This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America.History is history, and these are the facts.And if you're a person of color, you're excluded.His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context.The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton.The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut.But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions.Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison.But most history books have no mention of Latimer.Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776.Great nation, strong republic, yes!We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue.The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white.It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others.It must also go both ways.People of color cannot only talk.We must also listen.All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism.As Holder said, this will be uncomfortable, but "this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one America."Welcome to your seat Mr. Holder, it fits you well.

155     (CNN) -- There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare: .Mutual assured destruction.National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat: .It's not that the candidates are incapable of high-mindedness; they are extraordinarily bright.From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective.It never seems to stick.The harm is that it's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted.But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it.Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other.When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes.This year, asked the same question, only 12% said yes.And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style.In politics, it doesn't seem to inhibit the combatants.A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president.But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process.When the country loses that, it loses something essential.We are surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance.Meanwhile, Election Day is less than 10 weeks away.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

157     But first ... he has to graduate high school in May.But Jack, 16, hasn't been to high school much lately and isn't even sure he'll graduate.By contrast, some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful.TED.com: Granholm's clean energy proposal .There were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat.TED.com: Amanda Palmer -- the art of asking .SpaceX capsule reaches International Space Station .Keller Rinaudo demoed Romo, a $150 iPhone-powered robot that recently launched.13-year old invents system to protect family livestock from lions ."If kids grow kale, they'll eat kale," he said."If kids grow tomatoes, they'll eat tomatoes."TED.com: Sugata Mitra -- build a school in the cloud .(CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers).The ingenuity of this year's youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas.Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno.He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14.In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies.His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground.He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors.Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said.Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite.Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said.Andraka and Wilson probably don't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED.Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices.By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue."Thirty is not the new twenty," she said, urging people to "claim your adulthood" and start making choices.He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself.look a little closer .stare a little longer .that made you keep trying .despite everyone who told you to quit"

193     Another suspected suicide bombing struck the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Monday, killing at least 14 people and further highlighting Russia's security challenges as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics in less than six weeks.Vladmir Markin, a spokesman for the country's federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks.Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad.The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses.Based on the footage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus.The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber.Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber.Investigators said they also found an unexploded grenade at the scene.Russia's security challenge .The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009.In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others.Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack."Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan," RIA Novosti reported Monday.What might be behind the attacks?Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight.That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan.With tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia.The fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is "not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials," she added.Athletes are "most vulnerable" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said.They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.

242     Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor .Defence minister Anna Soubry said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces .The army was today ordered to end the booze-fuelled culture of ‘drinking to the point of oblivion’.Defence minister Anna Soubry said binge-drinking in the forces could not be justified as just a form of ‘comraderie’ or ‘letting down of the hair’.She was challenged by a committee of MPs about cheap alcohol on offer to troops, where a triple gin and tonic can cost as little as £1.But Ms Soubry, a former health minister, said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces, and called for less binge-drinking by serving personnel.But she said the ‘vast amounts’ consumed by the armed forces were unacceptable and must be scaled back.‘There is nothing wrong with some of that, but the levels of drinking to the point of oblivion and all the rest of it is a culture which I don't welcome in any workforce.‘The incidence of binge drinking, the quantities of alcohol, across society are beginning to diminish.Ms Soubry suggested that her determination to act had been strengthened by the death of a serving member of the armed forces.‘I read the coroner's report recently into a very sad suicide case of a serving person.There were many things in that report that concerned me.‘One of them, quite clearly, the culture of heavy drinking,’ she said.But she acknowledged that a cultural shift could not be encouraged purely by rules and regulations.‘You can't just put out edicts to change a culture,’ she said.

323     If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously.Founder of the Big Issue John Bird, who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight .For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing.The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all.Indeed, by reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness.If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do.I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life.Mr Bird says that reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness .Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison.What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose.The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid.I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work.The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster.The alternative — embodied in Ed Miliband’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money, only worsens the begging problem.Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity.Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend.The beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old Rebeca State, who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to Romania .They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here.But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses.That is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who Mr Miliband met in Manchester.As a ‘self-employed’ Big Issue seller six days a week, Ms Stoica can claim £550 a week in welfare.But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack.It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security.This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach.Ms Stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual, but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging.Are social services and the police investigating?And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents?For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison.

330     Beijing (CNN) -- Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child.But she's also found a way of making it pay."I don't want to waste my milk," she told CNN.I created a Web page and started my business."From Shanghai to Guangzhou, nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade."I just need to wait for calls," said Yan."I provide fresh and frozen breast milk.According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply.In contrast, a month's worth of conventional baby formula costs around 2,000 RMB (US$325) in China.The restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies.The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China.A number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers.On those sites, the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited."If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous," he said."We need laws for the breast milk business.""I think the business is totally fine.I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money," she said.

332     (CNN) -- The wife of the president of Oral Roberts University is denying allegations of improper behavior, saying the claims "sicken" her.Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's "Larry King Live" last week.Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her "sicken me to my soul.The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a "convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students" while the man acted as a "mentor."The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school.The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site.The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled "Scandal Vulnerability Assessment."The suit does not allege sexual behavior.In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit.Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence.It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school "to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university."The man had previously "confessed to crimes" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says.Asked whether someone is out to get him, he responded, "It sure seems that way."Lindsay Roberts called the allegations "preposterous."

333     But now one engineer has filmed spaghetti fracturing at 250,000 frames per second (fps) to explain why this happens.It seems that the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting of the pasta .This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent.If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ.Generally, rods - such as a pencil - eventually break into two if they are bent.When a piece of spaghetti was bent to breaking point, and the process was filmed at 250,000 frames per second, it was revealed that smaller broken pieces of pasta rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti moves 'downwards'.Engineer Destin Sandlin explained that the spaghetti strand is trying to straighten itself out, because it twists when it is bent into a curve.‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,' he explained.So the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting .Since his efforts, some physicists and mathematicians have worked to solve the mystery.This causes a wave to travel down the remaining strand of spaghetti before it can relax and un-twist.Destin Sandlin (in the video) noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally, appears to break downwards, after he flexed a strand to break it .'It's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out but it can't overcome its own mass,’ he explained in the video.‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,’ he said.So the fracturing is similar to a chain reaction of destructive untwisting, which leaves the spaghetti broken into pieces instead of snapping in two.His video confirms the work by the physicists at Marie Curie University.

344     (CNN) -- In 1834, Illinois voted whether to adopt Christmas as a legal holiday.Among those voting "nay" was the young Abraham Lincoln.In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote.Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834.The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards.Nobody was much shocked by these omissions.The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century.Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday.The federal government took until 1870 to follow.Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards.Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly "seasonal."Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations.Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences.Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath.Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia.Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition.Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century.When they champion "Christmas as it was," they do not mean "Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln" and much less "Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards."They mean, "Christmas as it was when I was young."It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about "the war on Christmas."The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.

346     (CNN) -- The "conservagencia" is starting to give Jon Huntsman a second look.But the stirrings of respect may be too little, too late.Too bad, because he might stand the best chance of beating President Barack Obama.RINO hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the Republican Party.Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann.All this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times.And so his actual record as governor and his policy plans as candidate were overlooked.Forget that he was the one candidate with real-world foreign policy experience.He was an apostate in a cult-like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty.It seemed to say more about the current makeup of the Republican Party than it did about Jon Huntsman.And now, all of a sudden, the Utah governor has started to get some respect."And I'm afraid we've elevated style to such a degree that it's clouding our view of what is conservative."He is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them.He has better foreign policy experience than either of them.Huntsman should be a conservative hero in this race."Huntsman's position on foreign policy is the most conservative.Jon Huntsman is putting all his chips on New Hampshire, where he's been inching forward in the polls.Tonight he will get a chance to shine in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate with Gingrich in New Hampshire.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.

347     (CNN) -- The Constitution says that only "natural born citizens" are eligible to be president.But it is likely that Cruz is a natural born citizen, because he was a citizen by birth.We have clear rules for who is a citizen by birth, and who can become a citizen after birth by naturalization, but neither the Constitution nor laws passed by Congress define "natural born citizen."So children born in England, even to parents who were not English themselves, were natural born subjects.The word "natural" was critical.English courts found that some people were naturally subjects if born in the dominion of the sovereign even if Parliament had passed no law making them such.Simply being born naturally created rights and duties.Politics: Who is eligible to run for president?The United States had natural citizenship in this same sense; white people born in the United States were always regarded as citizens, even before the Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1868, put that principle in the Constitution and extended it to African-Americans.Clearly, those born in the United States are eligible to be president; if they are not, no one is.As the child of a U.S. citizen mother, Ted Cruz was born a citizen by virtue of the Immigration and Nationality Act.But did that make him a natural born citizen?Instead, the question is who is a natural member of the political community.Most immigration and citizenship scholars, including me, believe that the answer is that any person who is a U.S. citizen at birth is naturally a part of the political community and hence eligible to be president.(I argued that John McCain was not eligible, because the statute granting citizenship to people born in the Canal Zone was passed only after he was born; since he was not a citizen at birth, he could not be a natural born citizen.)This argument seems wrong to most scholars.But whatever its merits, it is not likely to be tested in court.Other candidates are not likely to sue, but rather will focus on trying to win the election.

356     A father has attacked a court's decision to fine him more than £400 for taking his daughter out of school to go to her grandmother's funeral - despite the fact she missed 40 days of term-time.However, he was hauled before magistrates after his daughter, who was aged five at the time, failed to return to classes for more than a month.The couple were fined £416 including court costs after an original fine for keeping their daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment.Under new measures brought in last year, parents can now be fined for taking their children out of school during term-time.Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, can face a fine of up to £60 for every child.Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail.Mr Hussain, of Paddock, Huddersfield, disputes the court's decision and said he wanted the court case to go to trial because he wanted a jury to 'hear what he had to say'.He said: 'At the time I was not really bothered but I am annoyed about it now.It's not as if it was a pleasant trip for us to make.'I had no other choice but to take my daughter with me to do the burial.'The magistrates were not interested in what I had to say.I wanted a jury to hear what I had to say but it seems that's not possible.'Mr Hussain, 51, who appeared alongside his wife Humaira, 31, at Kirklees Magistrates' Court (pictured) was fined £416 after an original fine for keeping his daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment .'The court then determines whether the parents are guilty of an offence.Parents are advised of the process when they make the initial leave request.However, the mother was summoned to appear before magistrates for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’.Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates last month for failing to pay the £60 penalty fine, which was later increased to £120.Parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter after they took their three children (pictured together above) out of school for a week to attend a funeral service in Cumbria earlier this year .Mr and Mrs Overend-Hogg said they were 'disgusted' by the letter that awaited their return.

359     In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people.'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said.I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.'After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement.The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity.Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue.The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations.However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items.Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said.When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person.Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation.In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General.The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents.‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important.Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 .Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery.The investigation by Montana's Attorney General also found that CAI spent $4.93million on advertising and promoting Mortenson's books, costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did.'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong.Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath .Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book.Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children.

376     (CNN) -- There is nothing new under the sun, the saying goes, and it could not be more true than with the recycled literature of the popular "mommy porn" trilogy "Fifty Shades of Grey."The novel tells the story of Anastasia Steele, who finishes college by losing her virginity to billionaire Christian Grey, becoming his "submissive" in a sadomasochistic relationship.Neither extreme explains the novel's compelling relevance.Its abundant references to classic literature unlock a subtler commentary on enduring obstacles to women's individual freedom and rights.Paying attention to its literary signposts shows what has changed for women in that regard and what has not.Insistent references like this remind us that "Fifty Shades" is recycling the classic novel plot about a vulnerable young woman and a brooding older man.The hero has the lion's share of socioeconomic power; the heroine has only her magnetic strength and intelligence.News: Erotic book surges up best seller list .This last is exactly the fantasy that "Fifty Shades" sells.There is nothing new either about this plot's association with pornographic whips and chains.The whip and the vampire emerged in tandem with the marriage plot and chick lit.The still-disputed question Tess poses concerns whether the heroine is raped or seduced.Though Anastasia Steele is never raped, her individual agency is equally ambiguous.Yet she returns, echoing Tess: "The physical pain you inflicted was not as bad as the pain of losing you."Sadistic Christian always uses a condom, never uses porn and always puts her pleasure first.SPOILER ALERT: It turns out that he is a sadist because he was once victimized by older women.Lest you think women are unequal, the novel emphasizes the hero's ultimate powerlessness.No wonder female readers are falling for this story.When the story was first popularized in the 18th century, women had virtually no individual rights.Instead they clamor for the delusion that submission to men's greater power means being taken care of by them.Of course, pornography can be seductive, and "Fifty Shades" is hot.Less enjoyable is the undercurrent about women's lack of rights.Christian tells Anastasia, "You need to free your mind and listen to your body."

378     Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused in a separate incident of eluding an officer and resisting arrest, it was revealed today.It does not provide other details of the case.Earlier incident: Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused of speeding and resisting arrest .Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg .The Denver shooting also brought protests and a demand for a special prosecutor.On Friday, Hernandez's family called for a federal civil rights investigation into her death.The family said it doesn't trust Denver police to conduct a fair and timely investigation, and that the department has a history of exonerating its officers.He initially said the two officers opened fire after one was struck by the car.The incident remained under investigation.The passenger also claimed that Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot.Jordan suffered a fractured leg.A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home.She leaves behind five siblings .A passenger in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle  after being shot .Mrs Hernandez, a mother of six, said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.''I want to know, how did this happen?I want to know everything.'She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?'The grieving mother also criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot.Department policy encourages officers to move out of the way of a moving car rather than use their firearm.But it also allows them to shoot if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras.A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held.Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home .The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire.Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control.

379     Seeking freedom: Daniel Villegas, 35, has spent the last 18 years in prison after being convicted of killing two men .Villegas, who is now 35, continues to insist that the confession that led to his conviction, and which he has since recanted, was obtained by coercion.Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer.‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com.‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning.‘I'm going to delve into this,’ Medrano told El Paso Times.‘I'm going to start working on the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders .Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him .Prosecutors objected to the discs with more than 400 phone conversations being admitted, dismissing them as irrelevant to the case.England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene.Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh.His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help.Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect.Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting .In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims.The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders.‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News.Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case.Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence .‘He has provided no new evidence, which is required for someone who is claiming actual innocence,’ Briggs said.

396     Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions.More than half of all council tax revenue collected in Scotland went on local government pensions in 2011-12.Scottish councils paid £1billion in employer contributions for local government pensions, yet they collected just £1.9billion in council tax.The figures, unveiled by pensions expert Michael Johnson, are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable, he said.This would ultimately end with council taxpayers or the Treasury being landed with the liabilities for paying pensions.‘The public sector worker’s benefits will on average be three times more than what the private sector employee gets.’ Unlike other public sector schemes, employees do contribute to the Local Government Pension Schemes.Huge disparity: For city of London council workers the administration management costs are £317.30 compared to just £7.60 in West Yorkshire .But an ageing population and a public sector pay freeze has eroded the value of those contributions.Experts predict that within three years the scheme will run out of cash.The weakest funds were already selling off assets just to bankroll existing pensioners.He warned that the ‘ultimate liability will probable fall on council taxpayers’.There was also a ‘quiet assumption … that one day, the Treasury will step in’.Fund management costs were even more varied with City of London council workers paying £317.30 each compared to £7.60 in West Yorkshire.Mr Johnson called for some of the 101 pension schemes to be merged into several regional ones.The Mail understands that ministers and senior civil servants are closely scrutinising his recommendations.That will result in a formal consultation early in the new year.’

405     "They really are in good condition -- emotional condition and physical condition."After getting out of the capsule, each miner stood up and reconnected with loved ones.Some of them engaged the throngs nearby.While Manalich said "no major problems" have been found, all the rescued miners will be carefully monitored at a nearby hospital in the coming hours and days.The miners do not have to be flown to Copiapo Regional Hospital, Manalich said.However, officials strongly recommended it, and the miners have agreed to go, he said.Many of the miners rescued by late Wednesday afternoon had few evident medical problems, Manalich said, and dizziness was not a problem because the rescue capsule did not rotate as much as officials feared.Even so, all of the miners will be evaluated by specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists and psychologists."We've been ready since Day One of this disaster," he said last month.Some miners may be released as early as Thursday afternoon, Manalich said, while others will stay longer at the hospital.One expert has said the specter of post-traumatic stress disorder looms large.If the miners are given a clean bill of health, they will be released to their families.Because they have been isolated for so long, they could be more susceptible to the common cold or other viruses.Extensive precautions were taken to minimize health risks before the miners were rescued.One of them focused exclusively on the miner with pneumonia, who had an oxygen mask on his face when he came up."They have an anemic condition, and right now they have been sleeping less these last few days," Manalich said earlier Wednesday.The miners were switched to a liquid diet six hours before their rescue in case they vomit on the way up.They also had a series of vaccinations including a tetanus booster and flu shot.American astronaut Jerry Linenger knows something about isolation and confinement."Down in the mines you have gravity pulling you down.There will be disorientation -- turning your head will feel like doing 100 backflips in a row," he said.The health minister added later that, emotionally, he was surprised by how well the men were doing.Still, experts warn that psychological adjustments may remain a hurdle for the miners."So they were in survival mode, which is tough psychologically because you are in a life-and-death situation."

412     Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- Quick: Name the governor of Alaska.Nope, not Sarah Palin.Isn't on anyone's list of 2016 presidential candidates.He's trying to get Alaska to talk about the "resident evil" of rape."It's culturally permissible to be silent about it," and that must change, Parnell told me in a recent interview at the governor's office in Juneau.Related: The rapist next door .Parnell has helped end that era of senseless denial.In our interview, he called violence against women an "epidemic."The cornerstone of Parnell's campaign is his "Choose Respect" initiative, which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from Palin.The "Choose Respect" program would receive $12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor's proposed budget were approved.That's only 0.1% of the total proposed budget, but it's still considerable.His dad was in the Army and later served in the state legislature.He served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to Palin.Parnell was elected to the Alaska House at age 29.The lawless 'end of the land' But the governor's efforts to get Alaska to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves.I saw some results of the "Choose Respect" program firsthand: .That survey also has spurred change.5 ways to help end rape in Alaska .But violence stopped with Parnell's father, who was never violent, he said.Parnell is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts Alaska and should not be tolerated."That's been the hardest part about the evil among us: We haven't been willing to talk about it," the governor added."The 'Choose Respect' initiative has given Alaskans permission to speak about these things."Meet Alaska's pioneer woman .He added: "I'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame.Parnell would like the "Choose Respect" campaign to spread across the country."This is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people," he said.Those "real-deal heroes" should include people like Sarah Palin, the woman still more associated with the governorship in the American public's mind than Parnell.And -- forget celebrity -- they should include you, too.If you tag your photos, they will show up on this page.Bonus points if you can convince Sarah Palin to upload one, too.States where rape is most common .

436     Oh, and you get to fight with characters who have four arms.This force imbues Jackie with superhuman powers including two extra arms -- called "demon arms" in the game -- that look like snakes with piranhas for heads.And these extra arms are essential for in-game combat.Jackie has been keeping The Darkness bottled up inside, but there are others who want the power for themselves.As the game starts out, The Darkness gets released and helps Jackie in his war against the Brotherhood.When you're carrying four weapons with four arms, that's when the action and that's where it really gets bloody.The more gruesome the kill, the more Essence can be collected.The artwork in the game is very graphic-noir, with a hand-painted look.Each area was distinct with the appropriate overall emotional landscape.Darklings are back from the first title.These physical manifestations of the Darkness in your brain were used as weapons in the previous game.This time, there is only one and he acts more like a sidekick than a destroyer.There is also a point in the game where Jackie takes over the Darkling and you get to directly control it.The new viewpoint makes for a nice change of pace.That type of romantic story plays out mostly in cut scenes and cinematics.Also, the game seemed short.So I was a little disappointed when I realized the story was coming to a close.Overall, "The Darkness II" is a solid shooter that gets amplified by the fact that you get to fight with four arms.Using the demon arms to rip opponents to shreds or fling them into the sky never seems to get old.Oh, and much like today's movies, stick around after the credits."The Darkness II" is available in North America on February 7 and in Europe on February 10.It can be played on Windows PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.This review was done with the Limited Edition version for the PS3.

470     Hoping to 'dispel some of the myths' after leaked documents published by The Guardian and The Washington Post shed light on two top-secret government surveillance programs, James R Clapper said in a statement the purpose of the programs is 'to obtain foreign intelligence information, including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies'.The Guardian and The Washington Post also reported that another program, called 'PRISM', was used by U.S. intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook.In statements, those companies denied providing the government with special access to their files.Defensive: Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper said in a statement Saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were 'reckless' Both the phone-records program and .PRISM were approved by a judge, but PRISM allowed government agencies to .gain access to various Internet conversations, including email.In his statement, Clapper said PRISM, which was authorized in the Patriot Act, has been in place since 2008.Clapper called the disclosures 'reckless'.Clapper's statement came as a new Guardian report revealed more information on the NSA's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence.Congress also authorized the use of PRISM, which the fact sheet called an 'internal government computer system' and 'not an undisclosed collection or data mining program'.National security: Top intelligence official James R Clapper said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are 'necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies' The fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government.'Finally, the notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect.'I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,' he said according to multiple reports.We scrubbed them thoroughly–we actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards.But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks.You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience.We're going have to make some choices as a society.'

474     CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case.CNN: Did Bo and his legal team wrong-foot the leadership?Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable.If you reviewed his career he always surprised people.He has always played the wildcard.It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that.When you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare.Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges.The deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him.CNN: What's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption?Bo Xilai's real ambition is not about the money.He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader.By that time the whole country would be his.That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership.Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges.So what kind of verdict will they give him?CNN: What do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this "change of script"?Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him.In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent.I think the authorities' case is not in good shape on day one.CNN: Has the leadership's tactic backfired?He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys.He made a clear cut with his wife; blamed many things on his wife, especially the things that he claimed he did not know.Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument.Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict?So this case already has a strong impact.The leadership wants to move forward.Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous.But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial.
