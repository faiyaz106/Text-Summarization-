The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

0002095e55fcbd3a2f366d9bf92a95433dc305ef,"(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as ""The Milk Man,"" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. ""Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,"" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them ""inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas."" The organization ""has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,"" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison.

00027e965c8264c35cc1bc55556db388da82b07f,"A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston-Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re-test.","Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, had drunk at least three pints before driving car .

0002c17436637c4fe1837c935c04de47adb18e9a,"(CNN) -- With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Putin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.","Nina dos Santos says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions will hurt both sides .

The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time. In the lead: Jose Baxter (right) celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle (left) challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly-contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Clough’s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play-off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1-0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven days’ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last-minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.","Fleetwood top of League One after 2-0 win at Scunthorpe .

More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had. The former Los Angeles Lakers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs has helped Johnson - and millions of others - survive. Johnson, who became the face of HIV/Aids 22 years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities. Campaign: Magic Johnson has dedicated his life to raising awareness about HIV over the past 22 years . 'We have to drive people to get tested, . because that's the most important thing,' he told CBS News. 'The stigma and fear . of knowing their status' is holding people back. Johnson admitted that when his team's doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991 he was 'devastated'. 'At that time, people were really dying of Aids. I was just scared to death,' he said. The NBA star began treatment with Dr Michael Mellman and Dr David Ho, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival. But it was a meeting with Aids activist Elizabeth Glaser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness. Legend: NBA star Johnson, pictured here in 1985, was playing for the Lakers when he was told he had HIV . 'Scared': Johnson announces he has HIV at a Los Angeles press conference in 1991. He and wife, Cookie, left, were devastated by the diagnosis . Johnson said that Glaser, whose HIV had developed to Aids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months' pregnant at the time, about living with the disease. 'The one thing she did say was I was . going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was . become the face of the disease,' he said. 'She felt it was really . important that I go public to help a lot of other people who were living . the same lifestyle who didn’t know they had HIV and needed to get . tested ... And she was absolutely right.' His wife, Cookie, who tested negative . along with their son, told the Huffington Post: 'For us, it was super . hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying at . alarming rates. That was when people didn’t know anything about the . disease, so it was very frightening.' Awareness: This graph shows the estimated new HIV infections across subpopulations in the U.S. in 2010 . The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem's Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities. Despite representing only 12 per cent . of the population, black Americans account for about 44 per cent of new . HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the . disease. Hispanic Americans are also more . likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers . for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new . infections each year. Overall, about 1.1 million Americans are living . with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five . unaware of their infection. Support: Cookie and Magic Johnson in St Tropez earlier this year. Cookie was pregnant with their son when Johnson heard he had HIV . Star: NBA legend Magic Johnson has become a vital part of the Aids awareness campaign . 'In the black community, unfortunately, . we’re still in denial that it can happen to us. We haven’t done a . wonderful job of raising the awareness level or educating our people. Its gotten better since I announced 22 years ago, but it needs to get . much better,' he said.

This is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies. The London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station, Shropshire, on Saturday when the comments were made. Passenger Chris Downes, 46, was recording on his mobile at the time and the announcer can clearly be heard saying: 'Telford Central - please be aware of pickpockets and gipsies'. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies . The remark was mainly greeted by cheers from Shrewsbury Town football fans travelling back from their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. But London Midland said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service. Yesterday Wolves fan Mr Downes, who was on his way home to Bayston Hill, Shropshire, with son Jack, 14, said: 'There had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages, which threatened to boil over. The atmosphere was a bit hostile at times. 'The announcement diluted the situation quite a bit and helped lighten the mood, to be honest.'But I thought at the time he might get into a bit of trouble for it. Which is shame really, because I’m sure it was intended in good humour. 'When we got to Shrewsbury he said ""Welcome back to civilisation"" and I for one am looking forward to travelling on his train again in future. 'There’s not enough train drivers with a sense of humour and I think his comments were only made in jest.' However, other passengers and residents of Telford yesterday reacted with disgust at the 'unprofessional' and 'offensive' comments. Mark Peaker, 47, a father-of-three, from Telford said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was hearing - they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town. 'It suggests we are just a town full of thieves, which is not the case at all. Somebody in a professional role should not be insulting places while they are working. London Midland said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service . 'I’m all for them having a sense of humour but this was not funny at all and I hope he is disciplined for his unprofessional actions.' One Wolves fan, who lives in Telford but wished to remain anonymous, was travelling back home from the derby match at Molineux, which ended 0-0. He said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I was utterly flabbergasted. 'Tensions among fans were already high after the match and I don’t think that helped the situation at all. The London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station, Shropshire, on Saturday when the comments were made . 'Telford is actually a really nice place to live. It certainly isn’t up to a train announcer to make insulting comments about it.' The Gipsy Council called for the matter to be taken up with the police and branded the remarks as racist. Bill Kerswell, a spokesman for the council, said: 'This is unlawful, it is a racist comment. 'It is the same as using any offensive word relating to homosexuals or people of colour. 'I would think it is a police matter and I hope they take it up and look into it.' A spokesman for the train company thanked passengers for drawing it to their attention and added: 'We do not tolerate any sort of comment of that kind made by anyone on our trains and will be looking into it immediately.'","London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station in Shropshire .

00083697263e215e5e7eda753070f08aa374dd45,"There are a number of job descriptions waiting for Darren Fletcher when he settles in at West Brom but the one he might not have expected is Saido Berahino’s nanny. Fletcher’s unveiling as the deadline day signing from Manchester United was almost eclipsed by the 21-year-old striker, who is acquiring the habit of talking himself into trouble. Ten years Berahino’s senior, Fletcher will be expected to mentor a player who told the world this week that he wanted to play for a bigger club. Tony Pulis has advised Saido Berahino to focus on his performances at West Brom . Darren Fletcher has signed for the baggies where he will be asked to provide a role model for young players . That is off the pitch. On it, the Scotland midfielder wants to prove he is good enough to cut the mustard in the Premier League after finding starts harder and harder to come by at Old Trafford. Head coach Tony Pulis believes that Fletcher, who has agreed a three-and-a-half year contract, will be captain of Albion one day. Having checked with Sir Alex Ferguson last year when he was Crystal Palace, Pulis did not need any more due diligence before moving in when a deal with West Ham collapsed. Pulis wants Fletcher to be his voice in the dressing room, especially when it comes to the younger players who may be led astray. Berahino has caught the eye with impressive performances at West Brom and suggested he could move on . Berahino’s latest outburst this week comes after he was found guilty of drink-driving and after he moodly refused to celebrate a hat-trick against Gateshead. ‘Things are not what they used to be,’ added Pulis. ‘The mentors for these young lads are just not there. These kids need guides and mentors so that the youngsters can respect them and take notice. ‘I think Fletch will be critical to that sort of stuff but give him time to settle in. As a character, having worked with him for a week, he is first class. He got through his illness with flying colours and I see him as a future captain of the club.’ As for Berahino, he will escape a fine. ‘He's been in a naughty chair. That's in my office,’ joked Pulis, although the underlying message was rather more serious. ‘We've had no phone calls. He needs to stop listening to all the kerfuffle.. This is a great football club with great players. And Saido has not become that yet. Pulis praised recent recruit Darren Fletcher and feels he could be an ideal role model for Berahino . ‘The question was whether would he like to play in a top four team and everyone wants that. His responsibility is to work for us until that happens. ‘I've spoken to him and his people. He has to do it rather than talk about it. That's what good players do and then clubs will be interested. He's done an interview but not for what he was supposed to be talking about.’ Fletcher has already been impressed by Berahino on the training ground but admitted: ‘The lads have gone straight into him. He has said something and he will learn from it. ‘He loves West Brom and wants to do well. He’s a young player who said something he shouldn’t and he probably regrets it. I’ve done that, all young players do that. ‘On first impressions he looks very sharp, a real goalscorer. He’s not shy!. Giving me orders straight away because he wants to score goals. He’s a nice kid welcoming, respectful and can be big influence for rest of season.’","Tony Pulis believes Saido Berahino should look up to Darren Fletcher .

000940f2bb357ac04a236a232156d8b9b18d1667,"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- At first glance, it doesn't look like much. Hidden behind an unmarked door, in a nondescript government office building in the Australian capital, it could be mistaken for a high school science classroom with work benches, slightly outdated computer monitors, and the odd microscope sitting in the corner. But what happens in this room is anything but amateur. We're inside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident investigation lab, the place where the black boxes from Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 could be brought if and when they're recovered from the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean. The place that may play a critical role in solving the mystery of what happened to the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Our guide today is Senior Transport Safety Investigator Neil Campbell. An engineer by trade, he's been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades. Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenge of accident investigation, but there's another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work. ""Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public -- that's rewarding,"" he says. Just a handful of countries have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what's inside a black box. And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here. 'Object of interest' found . Retrieving the memory board . We start by the sink. Once the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder is retrieved from more than 4500 meters below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell. When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rinse the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart. Sometimes getting the data is simple. ""A lot of our work is with undamaged recorders and it's very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,"" Campbell says, as he flips open a slot on the end of the recorder. But the process becomes much more technical if the recorders are damaged by fire or water. On the shelves of the lab's main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions. Their metal casing is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior charred black. But even with these recorders, Campbell still has options to tackle what some might consider an impossible task. That's because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU). Campbell unscrews a couple of bolts. Wearing gloves and grounded to an anti-static mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective insulation. In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand. This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live. In the case of the Boeing 777, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,000 parameters for up to 25 hours. Those include everything from altitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, even cabin temperature and pressure. Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second. The cockpit voice recorder captures four audio channels for a maximum of two hours before overwriting. One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: ""We could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,"" Campbell explains. If there's water damage, Campbell says he will rinse the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven. That process can take a couple of days. Decoding the data . When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones. Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to decode each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when. To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audio analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor. For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, tragically ending in the death of both pilots on board. Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in helping the public understand an accident: ""There's a satisfaction in working out what happened with the accident and the conclusions, and the closure that that brings."" Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370 end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. CNN's Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","Black box data from Flight 370 could be analyzed at a laboratory in Australia .

Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north . You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian. Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured). The Gall-Peters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator . A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface . Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to cones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar 'Mercator' projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands . The Werner heart-shaped project of the world (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head . For instance, The ‘Be On Guard!’ map was . created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine . and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Hinese Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of East and Western cultures. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map . Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the Americas, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific lapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre, and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes at a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and 'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this, brilliant designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda.

Google Maps claims that it is on a ‘never-ending quest for the perfect map’, but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn’t so sure. He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes. ‘No world map is, or can be, a definitive, transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world,’ he writes. ‘Each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users, as their understanding of the world changes.’ This map was used in 1782 by British diplomats negotiating an end to the American War of Independence in Paris. Richard Oswald, secretary to the delegation, annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the U.S./Canada border .","The distortion is the result of the Mercator map which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world .

000e009f6b1d954d827c9a550f3f24a5474ee82b,"(CNN) -- One can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another American corporation has announced plans to invert, which is corporate-speak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress. Now that corporate giants such as Pfizer, Walgreen, Medtronic and Mylan have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, Congress may finally act. These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business. Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company. If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain ""operational headquarters"" in Minneapolis, where the company is currently based. In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign. (Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion.) Walgreen, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland. Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills. According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversions could provide an additional $19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. Even among corporations that aren't pursing inversions, shifting profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes is a huge problem. For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data. It's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that are exponentially larger than that country's entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U.S. taxes. American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U.S. taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen. Corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders. Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries. A recent exposÃ© explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll Rand suddenly began reporting U.S. losses or very small profits each year after inverting to become a Bermuda corporation in 2001. This did not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business. Rather, the corporation accomplished this by loaning $3 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. Defenders of corporate inversions often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate. Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here. But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true. The ultimate goal of much multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate. Reducing the nation's corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U.S. taxes altogether. Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments. The drugs and devices made by Pfizer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreen, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs. They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible. Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U.S. economic system without contributing their fair share. But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign. The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here. There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, but we can't afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge. If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.","U.S. corporations merge with foreign companies, move their headquarters .

'Dear Lupita,' reads the letter. 'I think you're really lucky to be this black but yet this successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Dencia's Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me.' 'My heart bled a little when I read those words,' the actress said through tears, explaining how as a child, she, too, would pray that she'd one day wake up with lighter skin. Hypocritical: Dencia is no stranger to controversy; in a February interview with Ebony, she essentially admitted that Whitenicious is intended as a skin-lightener, not as a cure for dark spots as it claims . Perpetuating the problem: 'When you take that picture and you put a picture of Dencia darker, this is what you're telling people - the product really works,' she said. 'And guess what? People really want to buy it' But while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration, Dencia took it as a personal attack. After her angry tweet at Miss Nyong'o, criticism poured in, with one person tweeting: 'B**** lupita is the new face of Lancôme!! SHE WINS!! And you're just TRASH [sic]'. In her response, Dencia said of the cosmetics company: 'But they sell bleaching cream tho [sic]'. The pop star is likely referring to Lancome's Blanc Expert range of cosmetics, which are actually advertised as 'brighteners' that 'regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin'. And as far as Dencia's claim that Lancome is a 'white people company', a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealers and foundations in darker skin tones.","Dencia's comment is hypocritical considering she recently courted controversy for marketing 'dark spot remover' Whitenicious, which is frequently used as a skin-whitening cream ."
00120f91cfcab17bac165f7a4719019a628a9db3,"Britain and the West must brace themselves for more bloody atrocities before Islamist jihadists in Iraq  are defeated, former top brass said  last night. Retired commanders issued the chilling warning as they urged David Cameron to deploy more RAF warplanes to fight Islamic State fanatics. The ex-military chiefs also suggested stepping up Special Forces operations to ‘spoil the day’ of the fanatics, including British Muslims, who have swept across northern Iraq. Recruiters: British jihadis Reyaad Khan, Nasser Muthana and Abdul Raqib Amin are seen in an IS video released earlier this year. In the video, the trio encourage other Britons to join them . Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after gruesome images were published on the internet of a jihadist, with a British accent, murdering US journalist James Foley – claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes. As Mr Cameron condemned the ‘brutal and barbaric murder’, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said British troops could be sent to Baghdad to help train Iraqi soldiers to counter the growing threat. So far the UK has deployed an RAF  Rivet Joint spy plane – a flying ‘listening post’ that picks up chatter made over mobile  phones or radios – and six Tornado fighter jets fitted with state-of-the-art surveillance equipment that beam real-time images of targets  to commanders. The aim is to gather vast amounts of crucial intelligence, including on militants’ manoeuvres, to support humanitarian efforts – but this could be used to support US bombers in strike missions to oust Islamic State. But Sir Michael, who served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1992 to 1997, warned the West must be prepared for jihadists taking retribution against other hostages as they were pounded by air strikes. Referring to Mr Foley’s murder, he said: ‘Being blunt, we sadly must expect more of this. We are dealing with fanatical, religious people who are long past the point of normal behaviour. They must be stopped.’ Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after a jihadist, with a British accent, murdered US journalist James Foley - claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes . He said the West should continue ‘evening the game up’ by supplying weapons, mortars and rockets to the Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers, who are fighting IS. ‘The jihadists have got their hands on artillery and weapons looted from the Iraqi army, which has given them a huge advantage. We should now be arming the Peshmerga to even up the playing field.’ Sending more RAF reconnaissance planes to the troubled region ‘will always be useful’ in building up an intelligence picture of the fanatics. Sir Michael said UK Special Forces on the ground could be deployed on top-secret operations to inflict huge damage on advancing extremists. ‘What I think they can do, if they are working closely with the Peshmerga, and I’m sure they are, is conduct missions which require the jihadists to mass [in an area] and the moment they mass, you have got a target. Then you can send in bombers and do things to them that really spoil their day.’ Air Commodore Lambert, who commanded Allied forces in enforcing a no-fly zone over northern Iraq in 1999, said he believed Britain should put on a greater show of military strength to deter the jihadists. In responce to the shocking footage of Foley's beheading, which was titled 'A Message to U.S.', British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond to vow Britain would 'oppose ISIS with every breath in our body' He said: ‘If you want me to make one criticism, it’s this: the scale of the operation is probably too small. When we had the no-fly zone, there were 50 or 60 aircraft. Symbolically it quite often is useful to give messages to people that if you have a robust package then people take you more seriously that you know what is going on.’ He said deploying more RAF planes with reconnaissance equipment would allow ‘continuous coverage’ of the battlefield, compared to only a few hours that the RAF can do at present. Air Commodore Lambert added: ‘Obviously, if the threat increases then I would expect the UK and US to increase the number of assets there.’ One of the British jihadists in the region, Nasser Muthana, is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in Islamic State’s first professionally produced English-language propaganda video, which urged young Muslims in the West to join the terror group. Yesterday, Muthana mocked US efforts to defend Iraq’s Yazidi minority from genocide at the hands of IS militants, saying on Twitter they ‘can’t even protect their own citizens’. The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State’, said last month the UK government should be ‘afraid’ of his bomb-making skills. Muthana has been joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17. The brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young Britons who have travelled to Syria to join the rebels. British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. In the wake of US journalist James Foley’s brutal murder, they urged imams and mosques to do more to combat extremists – even if it means risking reprisals. Some imams have already made repeated appeals to radicalised youngsters not to join militants in the Middle East. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged Islamic communities to unite and tell the jihadists: ‘Not in our name.’ British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. Including Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford . But critics have unfavourably compared the recent appeals, via open letters and YouTube videos, with the thousands-strong marches organised to protest Israel’s military action against Gaza, or the publication of a  cartoon of Mohammed in a Danish magazine. Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, said: ‘This grotesque murder characterises Muslims as barbaric savages. If this senseless killing doesn’t change people’s attitudes, what will? ‘In the UK the majority of the Muslim population are Sunni and the Sunni group has been remarkably silent about what is happening in Iraq. The time has now come for a mass outcry from mainstream Muslims, not only about this murder but also the persecution of the Iraqi Yazidis and Christians and the killing of other Muslims.’ Abu Muntasir, chief executive of the Muslim educational charity JIMAS, added that some religious leaders had been too slow to condemn the Islamic State terrorists due to fear of reprisals from extremists in Britain. He admitted: ‘In the past I have been more careful and shown restraint but enough is enough. ‘I’m prepared to take more risks to defy these evil people. I utterly condemn IS even if it puts me at personal risk, at danger of people coming to my home. I’m no longer prepared to be muted.’ He called on the Government to take tougher action against jihadists who travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight – despite having supported jihad himself in the past. The married father of 12 said he fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, but now believed fighters were driven by aggression, not religious devotion. He told the Daily Mail: ‘They seek guns and violence. It is not about jihad or religion, it is all pure escapism and adventure.’ Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of Manchester’s Ramadhan Foundation, said Britain would be at risk of terror attacks if radicalised fighters are allowed to return. He spoke out against IS, formerly known as ISIS, saying: ‘I utterly condemn the senseless and barbaric killing of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIS. ‘If this barbaric killing was not enough then the allegation that the beheading was carried out by a British citizen is deeply worrying for our nation.’ The Muslim Council of Britain released a statement saying: ‘Each day ISIS seeks to carry out an act more barbarous than the day before, craving the oxygen of publicity to give credibility to their heinous acts. ‘We condemn unreservedly their psychopathic violence, whether it is on minorities, on civilians or on fellow Muslims.’","Ex-military chiefs suggested .

Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other after they returned to their Bergen, New Jersey home following a party early on Monday. When Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, 45, tried to break them up, Hernandez Soriano assaulted the woman, according to the Bergen County Prosecutor. 'During the assault, the victim apparently suffered a cardiac event which resulted in her death,' Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said in a statement. Fight: Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, above, and her boyfriend Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other at their home on Monday when his mother intervened . Injured: Martinez Rojas' booking shot shows the scratches on his face from the domestic dispute . A seven-year-old child also witnessed the fight, according to the prosecutor, but he did not reveal the relationship between the adults and the youngster. Police responded to a 911 call from the apartment just after 4am on Monday and when they arrived, they found Rojas-Jovel dead on a bedroom floor. 'There were no obvious signs of trauma to the victim, however... the [couple] displayed signs of injury and appeared to have been involved in a domestic assault,' the prosecutor said. In their booking photos, both Hernandez Soriano and Martinez Rojas have scratches on their faces and necks. The pair were interviewed, as were the child and other residents. Scene: Soriano allegedly then assaulted the woman, Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, and she suffered a cardiac arrest at the first-floor apartment at the house (pictured) and died before police arrived at the scene . The Bergen County Medical Examiner's Office conducted an autopsy on Rojas-Jovel's body, but results were pending toxicology tests, the prosecutor said. Hernandez Soriano was charged with manslaughter, endangering the welfare of a child, domestic violence simple assault and hindering apprehension, according to authorities. Molinelli said Hernandez Soriano also hid evidence - but would not detail what it was - which investigators later recovered in a search at the crime scene. She was held at the Bergen County Jail on $250,000 bail. Martinez Rojas was also charged with child endangerment and domestic violence simple assault and sent to the county jail on $75,000 bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for Thursday morning at Hackensack Superior Court.","Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started fighting after returning from a party on Monday morning .

00142065a6c92f788eacd40c9023184808a7e2d1,"Beirut (CNN) -- Syria carried out an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Lebanon Saturday, killing nine Syrians and wounding nine more, a Lebanese state-run news agency reported. The strike centered on a Syrian refugee camp located near the Syrian border between the towns of Baalbeck and Arsal in the Bekaa Valley, the National News Agency said. The Red Cross took the casualties to Universal Hospital in Baalbek. Saturday's strike was not the first by the Syrian government, which has accused rebels of smuggling arms and supplies across the border. On March 18, two Syrian jets fired three rockets that hit empty buildings near Arsal. At the time, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman called the use of fighter jets to fire rockets into Lebanon a ""significant escalation."" U.N. commissioner wants to probe into whether Syrian rebels executed soldiers . Also in March, the U.N. Security Council voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of cross-border fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abductions and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border, as well as other border violations."" The declaration followed a briefing by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a country of about 4 million people, according to a U.N. estimate. But the Lebanese government puts the total at more than 1 million. Whatever the true figure, there is no dispute that the influx has destabilized the area and heightened tensions. The attack comes as the Syrian conflict is mired in a third year of unrest, which started in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 and transformed more than 1 million others into refugees, according to the Red Cross.

Roman Shilov, whose wife and the baby daughter live in Brisbane, was detained by Russian authorities on charges of drug trafficking in July 2012, according to the ABC. He has never met his daughter. The Australian and Russian citizen has been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk, despite the Australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport, a letter from Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has revealed. Roman Shilov, whose wife and the baby daughter he's never had the chance to meet live in Brisbane, was detained by Russian authorities on controversial charges of drug trafficking in July 2012 . 'Regrettably, Russian authorities have not accepted this advice and remain committed to having Mr Shilov remain in detention,' Ms Bishop wrote in a letter to the Shilov family's local MP. The letter also noted that the Russian Government was refusing to recognise Mr Shilov's dual nationality which in turn 'seriously limits the ability of the Australian Government to provide consular assistance'. Mr Shilov had returned to Moscow three years before his arrest to assist his father with his spice trade business which supplied up to 20 per cent of the country's poppy seed market at the time, the ABC reported. Poppy seeds are currently classified as narcotics by the Russian government. The Australian and Russian citizen, who has been detained without trial for two and a half years, has now been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk despite the Australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport . One of the charges laid against Shilov and his father by Russia's Federal Drug Control Service is the importation of 47 tonnes of narcotics. The ABC reported that this shipment was made up entirely of poppy seeds and the Service had even admitted that only 0.001 percent of it could be extracted as narcotics. Evgeny Shilov, Mr Shilov's brother who also lives in Brisbane, told the ABC that the minimum 15 year sentence was worrying and expressed concern over his brother's detainment. 'It seems very, very unfair that he's been put away from day one and hasn't been let go,' he said. Evgeny Shilov, Mr Shilov's brother who also lives in Brisbane, told the ABC that the minimum 15 year sentence was a worrying one and expressed concern over his brother's long term detainment . 'I'm still hoping that it's going to get resolved. That's all."" The Department of Foreign Affairs told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'Where there have been concerns expressed about his [Mr Shilov's] health or welfare in prison, the Department has made representations to Russian authorities. 'Consular officials are also in regular communication with the man's family and his legal advisers about his case.'","Roman Shilov has been detained by Russian authorities without trial since July 2012 .

00156d9892fb27f1d2e100cbdd8a3997f8273781,"Everton are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverley of Manchester United among the options for Roberto Martinez. The midfielder made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt  but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to kick-on in the last year with any consistency. Everton manager Martinez was widely credited with improving Cleverley while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Everton need to sign a few more players . On the move? Everton are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder Tom Cleverley, with manager Roberto Martinez believing he can reinvigorate the England man . Previous experience: Martinez worked with Cleverley when he was manager of Wigan in 2010-11 . Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for the friendly against Roma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they have made the cut for his planned 22-man squad. The midfielder did not excel against Roma but like many of the United players is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Everton have already splashed out in excess of £35m this summer with Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Henen's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu has hit stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8million. Bradford, Cleverley's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell on. Decision time: Louis van Gaal will trim his United squad to 22 after their tour of the United States . Statement of intent: Everton have already spent big on striker Romelu Lukaku this summer . VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad . Martinez may yet prefer to bring in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker but Cleverley's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from Everton. The concern at United would be that Martinez could find the key to re-invigorating Cleverley. Van Gaal though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Deals for Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES . Frank Lampard's arrival at Manchester City has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the Premier League champions' squad will be be made available. Sunderland are among the front runners pushing for a deal with Jack Rodwell while Valencia remain eager to take Bruno Zuculini on loan. Incoming: Frank Lampard's arrival on loan at Manchester City could lead to the departure of other players . Good impression: Bruno Zuculini has looked good on Manchester City's pre-season tour of America . Oriol Romeu has returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be loaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia want a defensive-minded midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Racing in Argentina but showed on the US tour why City have brought him into their squad. Valencia now hope to give him a season in La Liga where he can continue to improve. However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo La Coruna, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool's defensive starlet Tiago Ilori. SOUTHAMPTON CHASING 'MUSKETEER' SCHELOTTO . Southampton will hold further talks with Inter Milan over winger Ezequiel Schelotto on Tuesday. The 25-year-old should certainly give Ronald Koeman's team a better cutting edge as his nickname is 'El Mosquetero' or 'The Musketeer' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier-swishing style on the wing. It is understood the nickname he actually prefers is 'El Galgo' or 'the Greyhound'. Negotiations: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is close to sealing the signing of Ezequiel Schelotto . Whatever name he wishes to use, Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is keen to push a deal forward. They have agreed terms on Dani Osvaldo and are discussing a loan for midfielder Saphir Taider also. Schelotto's agent Bruno Carpeggiani said: 'The situation with Southampton is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead.' Although Argentininian born and raised, Schelotto has been capped by Italy. He spent part of last season on loan at Parma. CANAS SWAPPING SWANSEA FOR ELCHE . Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain. Celta Vigo, who are playing a series of friendlies in England at the moment, have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Swansea manager Garry Monk left Canas out of the club’s pre-season tour to the US, leading his representatives to begin negotiations with Elche sporting director, Victor Orta. Return: Swansea's Jose Canas is holding talks with Elche ahead of a possible return to Spain . Swansea remain on the trail of Almeria's Ramon Azeez and have made enquiries about the Nigerian. Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya. Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000-a-week derailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures won't be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Torres who is on around £150,000. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there's a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it doesn't matter. Even then, we're in control - so all of that doesn't matter, because it's speculation - Wilfried's our player.' Demands: Wolfsburg have shown an interest in Wilfried Bony, but his wages could be a stumbling block . NEWCASTLE SIGN FOREST DUO . Newcastle will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest on Monday and loan the pair back. Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility. The 23-year-old France midfielder has long been in Newcastle's sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team. If one of those does not come along soon, the greater the Toon's chances become. Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while . LIVERPOOL WRAP UP MORENO DEAL . Liverpool's search for a left-back should be concluded soon as talks progress with Sevilla over the £16m transfer of Alberto Moreno. Sevilla have enquired about Sporting Lisbon's 26-year-old Jefferson Nascimento as a potential short term replacement. LAZIO INTERESTED IN KABOUL . Lazio's interest in Younes Kaboul should help Tottenham offset their pending outlay on Eric Dier and Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal. Tottenham have no plans to sell Jan Vertonghen as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for Michael Dawson. Kaboul, 28, is valued at around £6m by Tottenham although Lazio want to pay around £3m. They are also looking to offload Michael Ciani to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have no interest in Samuel Eto'o, who is looking more likely to return to Italy at this stage with West Ham also looking at younger options. On his way? Lazio are willing to pay Spurs £3m for Younes Kaboul . WEDNESDAY IMPRESSED BY KELHAR . Sheffield Wednesday have offered Slovenian trialist Dejan Kelhar a short-term contract. The 30-year-old defender, who has won six caps for his country and last played for Red Star Belgrade, has been training at Hillsborough and played in some of their pre-season friendlies. Manager Stuart Gray remains keen to sign a striker but Kelhar has also done enough to earn a deal. Gray said: 'We are offering Dejan a short-term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us. Nothing has been finalised, he is mulling it over at the moment.' STOKE STOPPER BACHMANN HEADS TO WREXHAM ON LOAN . Stoke's young goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann is poised to join Conference side Wrexham on loan.

Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has shocked Twitter followers by offering £50,000 to anyone who could identify - and break the arms of - a sinister tweeter who threatened to harm his daughter. The self-made millionaire became embroiled in a row yesterday afternoon after receiving a string of anonymous threats via the micro-blogging service. The messages threatened to 'bring hurt and pain' to his family unless he handed over £35,000. Reward: Duncan Bennatyne sent out this message to his 372,000 followers . And although Mr Bannatyne later withdrew his threat, the entrepreneur said 'I'd gladly do my time' to get revenge on the anonymous tweeter. The TV star received a series of tweets from someone calling himself Yuri Vasilyev, linking to a message threatening to harm Hollie Bannatyne, 25. He responded by posting: 'I offer £25,000 reward for the capture of the coward who calls himself @YuriVasilyev_ Double if his arms are broken first'. Although this tweet was soon deleted, Mr Bannatyne posted another message saying: 'OK £30,000 reward for info leading to his arrest'. The drama began yesterday, when he . received a message from the Twitter account @YuriVasilyev_ which linked . to a message about Holly. It read: 'Dear Dragon. My name is . Yuri Vasilyev and I'm looking for a £35,000 investment to stop us . hurting your Hollie Bannatyne. We will bring hurt and pain into your . life. 'We are watching her. She is very attractive. Want photos? Tweet using the hashtag £4money to confirm payment will be made.' Threatened: Duncan Bannatyne received sinister messages threatening his daughter Hollie, right . A . later message said: 'Duncan Bannatyne - Hollie is going to get hurt. We . will bring pain and fear. You should have expected us. We are the men . of Belarus. 'We do not give up. We will stand . tall. You should have paid. £35,000 to stop it. Contact us to pay. We . are watching. Expect us. We are the men of Belarus.' Despite Vasilyev's claim to be from Belarus, Mr Bannatyne has said that he believes him to be in Moscow. His latest message to Vasilyev reads: 'Go home to your mum and cry we are closing in on you little boy'. That message was also later deleted. Mr Bannatyne's threats have met a mixed reaction from Twitter users. Many have helped to try to locate Vasilyev, although this is unlikely to be successful without tracking him down electronically, as 'Yuri Vasilyev' is a common name in Russian-speaking countries. But one user, speculating that Vasilyev was using a fake name, told Mr Bannatyne: 'Whoever the real Yuri Vasileyev is I hope hijacking his identity & ur call to vigilantes doesnt end in his injury or death.' [sic] . Mr Bannatyne said in a statement: 'My family is well protected, but I take any threat to them very seriously and will do all I can to ensure the person or people involved are caught.' Last night, police issued a statement saying: 'Durham Constabulary can confirm Duncan Bannatyne has reported a number of threatening messages he had received via email and Twitter in which threats were made against a member of his family. 'These appeared to originate from an email address based in Russia. 'We have been liaising since then with Mr Bannatyne and conducting enquiries into the credibility of these threats.' Mr Bannatyne contacted the Durham Constabulary because his family have long been based in the North East.",Police brought in over Twitter threats believed to be made by man in Russia .
001789cf9b865dcac3d9fc032a6b1533e3318eda,"Last updated at 3:31 PM on 19th July 2011 . Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000. Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years . The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state. Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said. New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population. New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found. The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000. Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago. 'Empire State of Mind': An Amish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Amish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Mr Kraybill said: 'It's remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America.' Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote. Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam. Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state's Amish was published last year, said: 'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.' The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes. Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century. 'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren't any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,' she said. 'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.' Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time. Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment. That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.

Johnson, like Steven Gerrard, can start talking to foreign clubs in 31 days about joining them on a Bosman at the end of the season. But whereas Liverpool are in talks with their captain about a new deal, Johnson’s situation is drifting. The full back is clearly still committed to the cause — ending up with stitches in his head after diving in to score the winning goal — but has accepted that the end may be near. Liverpool's Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1-0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield . Liverpool have not made any contact with him about extending his terms and Johnson, who has attracted interest from Roma, insists that he will not be pleading for a new deal. ‘I want to play for a club that wants me,’ said Johnson, who moved to Merseyside from Portsmouth for £17.5million in 2009. ‘I’ve seen some stuff that I have been offered half the money I am on. That’s not true. I haven’t been offered anything. ‘Time goes very quick. I’ve enjoyed my time here, the majority of the six years. There have been some good times, some bad times. But if I haven’t got a contract, I can’t stay. It does play on your mind but you have to be professional and do your best. I respect my team-mates more than anyone. Johnson celebrates scoring the vitally important winner with a thumbs up to the Anfield crowd late on . ‘I’m not going to go crawling to anybody. They know where I am and they know the situation. There were minor talks at the end of last season but nothing that I could accept or reject. ‘I don’t worry about things that I can’t control. All I can keep doing is my job. Whatever will unfold will unfold. It’s not my business to talk to other clubs. I’m concentrating on winning for Liverpool. I want to respect my contract and that’s what I will do.’ This has not been an easy season for Johnson. With Brendan Rodgers constantly chopping and changing his defence, his form has dipped and he has lost his place in the England squad. Johnson is congratulated by his Liverpool team-mates but needed treatment after taking a hit while scoring . That has led to him becoming a target for supporters’ frustrations. There were a number of growls on Saturday when he made a mistake in the third minute. Aside from that Johnson did little wrong and followed up bravely after Rickie Lambert’s effort struck the woodwork. ‘It hurts a lot less when the ball hits the net,’ said Johnson. ‘When Rickie headed it, I thought it was going to hit the bar, so I just kept going. We fought hard and I would have been very upset if we’d only drawn. We deserved to win.’ Rodgers sprinted down the touchline and celebrated the goal with supporters. Behind him, his assistants and Liverpool’s substitutes vaulted from their seats. Rodgers reflected: ‘There was a feeling of elation, probably a mixture of relief. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard looks on from the bench during the first half after being rested for the match . VIDEO Gerrard denies Rodgers rift . ‘We’ve got to make slow steps. The scrutiny was on us in a big game against a tough side but we came through it very well.’ Stoke will consider themselves unlucky. On another day Bojan Krkic would have scored rather than hitting the post. ‘There wasn’t any real momentum behind Liverpool’s play and we dealt with that quite easily,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes. ‘We let ourselves down. We had three or four defenders and (Johnson) reacted quicker than we did when it bounced off the bar.’ Liverpool manager Rodgers looks cheerful after his side secured a late win at Anfield against Stoke .","Full back scored late winner as Liverpool beat Stoke 1-0 on Saturday .

A Florida woman said she was humiliated by local police as she accused them of hogtying her, parading her around topless and bashing some of her teeth out during her arrest last year. Ashleigh Davis, of Ocala, Florida, said she found herself on the wrong side of the law in April of last year at the Leesburg Bikefest after she and another woman were having an argument. When police asked her to leave, she reportedly refused, and was bound by her hands and feet by officers from the Leesburg Police Department and Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Humiliation: Ashleigh Davis can be seen laying topless in the middle of a holding cell, surrounded by several male officers . Damage: Davis said her teeth were cracked after one of the officers slammed her head into the floor . Speaking out: Davis says she deserved to be arrested, but not the brutality she claims to have suffered . The 32-year-old said that while she was being detained, her bikini top fell off, and officers whisked her away topless in front of onlookers. Davis told the Palm Beach Post: '[Officers] handcuffed my hands to my feet and then took a tie and tied it around, then carried me like a suitcase and threw me on the back of a golf cart.' Busted: Davis was given a green sweater for her booking photo . She told the paper that she suffered further shame at the Leesburg Police Department, as she laid nearly naked on the floor of the police station holding cell while a group of officers laughed at her. Davis said that the abuse didn’t stop there, as one of them allegedly smacked her face against the floor and chipped some of her teeth after she had bitten him. She told the Post: 'I just remember him grabbing me from behind, my hair and [covered my mouth] and then I try to bite, and then they grabbed me by the back of my head and slammed my face down.' She admits that she probably deserved to be arrested, but that the officers she dealt with were way over the line. Davis was charged with two counts of aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and disorderly intoxication, and is serving probation in the case. She claimed that she had filed a complaint against the officer, days after her arrest. Her attorney, Stan Plappert, told WESH.com: 'I think they should have sensitivity training. You would think that they would know that, ""hey, I have a topless woman or a nearly naked person. I need to do something to cover them up, to give them some dignity.""' Davis added: 'I don't want this to happen again. I want people to be treated the way we’re supposed to be treated, and yes, I'm paying for what I did, and I want them to pay for what has happened to me.'

The firm says the new baby will swell the coffers and enhance the assets of the family as a whole, including Crown Estate and Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, which stands at £53.6 billion.

A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners together have told how they won £50,000 backing from the Dragons' Den investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Hate It and Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Marmite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Dragons' Den to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren't allowed to mention the name Marmite to the inquisitive Dragons. Scroll down for video . The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games - and persuaded the Dragons to invest . Dragons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Jones, second right, put up £50,000 for the board games . Mr McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Betty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and Esmee, 13, said: 'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn't mention Marmite on the show as they hadn't yet agreed the design of the game. 'They didn't want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Dragons wouldn't be interested.' Three Dragons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones demanding to know more. Mr McLuckie said: 'We told them we couldn't say the name but it was an iconic brand and a well-known supermarket brand. 'Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Jones said ""Oh it's Marmite"", and they agreed to invest. Jones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men's games start-up, Pants On Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Hate It, the title of which is based on the idea that Marmite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up . The idea for Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge came to Mr McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Marmite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: 'My wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. 'It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.' He and Mr Mackenzie-Walker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and Mr McLuckie needed a new job. First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made-up facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Marmite. Mr McLuckie and his childhood friend Mr Mackenzie-Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games . Mr McLuckie and Mr Mackenzie-Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Kent to southern Spain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, WH Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. They appeared on Dragons' Den last night, and said their preconceptions about the Dragons were shattered after meeting them. 'We thought we'd really like Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Kelly was a little bit rude and dismissive,' Mr McLuckie said. 'Deborah Meaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hard-nosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful - so lovely. 'We thought Peter Jones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard task-master, when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two.

Andrew Moss: He will be paid £80,000 a month for the next year . The boss of Britain’s biggest insurance company will continue to receive his salary of £80,000 a month for the next year despite his humiliating resignation yesterday. Andrew Moss, who has quit as chief executive of Aviva after a shareholder revolt, will receive a golden goodbye worth around £1.75million in total. Last Thursday, 59 per cent of shareholder votes failed to back his gold-plated pay package worth up to £5.2million last year. It was the latest chapter in the growing backlash against boardroom greed, nicknamed the Shareholder Spring. Yesterday the 54-year-old chief executive said he ‘felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership’. But Mr Moss, who has also sparked public criticism for leaving his wife of 25 years and their four children for a junior married colleague, Deidre Galvin, in 2009, will not be leaving empty-handed. Walked: Aviva Group chief executive Andrew Moss, who is to step down with immediate effect . He will be paid his £960,000 ‘basic’ annual salary for the next year, equal to £80,000 a month, unless he finds another job. Mr Moss will also get a £300,000 bonus payment, a cash injection of £209,000 into his pension pot in five years’ time, deferred shares from a 2009 bonus, currently worth around £236,000, and a maximum of £45,000 in legal and other expenses. He has two pensions from Aviva: one worth around £530,000 and one worth around £2.75million, including the £209,000 payment. Mr Moss’s departure was announced on the eve of today’s Queen’s Speech, which is expected to fire the starting gun on a crackdown on boardroom excess and empower shareholders to veto any examples of corporate excess. Bounce: Shares in the UK's largest insurer jumped five per cent following the announcement, suggesting investors approve of Mr Moss's departure . Investor backing: The announcement was immediately followed by a spike in Aviva's shares . At present, shareholders can vote . against pay deals, but their votes are not binding on the company and . directors can still receive the controversial pay and bonuses. The main . role of such votes is to embarrass bosses and damage the firm’s . reputation. The mood of investors has turned ugly recently, triggering . the departure of bosses at drugs company AstraZeneca and newspaper group . Trinity Mirror. Turmoil: Aviva's St Helen's skyscraper looms in the City, where three CEOs have quit amid recent shareholder anger . Yesterday, . the chief executive of William Hill, Ralph Topping, was the latest . victim, with nearly 50 per cent of the betting firm’s shareholders . voting against a £1.2million bonus and a 8.3 per cent pay rise. At its . annual meeting, one angry shareholder said: ‘Chief executives are dining . in the last chance saloon trying to take as much as they can as soon as . possible.’ Business . Secretary Vince Cable, who has heavily criticised boardroom excess, said . bosses are finally being ‘brought back to reality’. He welcomed the . ‘uprising’ by shareholders as ‘a healthy development’, and said he is . determined to stamp out ‘rewards for failure’. Since . Mr Moss became chief executive in July 2007, Aviva’s share price has . more than halved, decimating the nest eggs of thousands of its smaller . shareholders. Liberal Democrat . Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Shareholder votes must be binding, otherwise it . just like a jury who acquit a man of a murder charge but the judge still . gives him 20 years. What’s the point?’ Deborah . Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre campaign group, said: ‘The irony is . that Aviva was behind some of the recent pay revolts but, at the same . time, they were not looking after their own backyard. ‘This . is what makes Mr Moss’s payoff so intolerable. Aviva’s corporate . governance arm was lecturing others about pay and yet the company was . ignoring its own advice.’ Mr . Moss ceased to be chief executive ‘with immediate effect’ yesterday, but . he will not officially leave until the end of the month. Meanwhile, the average pay of bosses at Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to £3.65million, according to research published yesterday. The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the FTSE 100 index. On average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus several other lucrative perks, according to the research. But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services. The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time when inflation is 3.5 per cent. The report found that 8 per cent of workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen.","Andrew Moss is third victim of recent discontent after departures at Trinity Mirror and AstraZeneca .

001ee59c375363263821474d40e4386ab91d5145,"These days we pick up a packet of frozen prawns from the supermarket almost without thinking. They’re healthy, flavour-some and cheap enough to count as an affordable treat, perhaps on a skewer for a barbecue or daintily arranged for a dinner party starter. If we give even a moment’s thought about where they come from we probably imagine a sun-burnished fisherman skilfully tossing his nets out into the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean or South China Sea before hauling in his valuable catch. Nothing, I’m afraid, could be further from the truth. Intensively farmed: Jumbo tiger prawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the prawn farms . As an environmental journalist, I’ve visited Thailand, the world’s leading exporter of farmed king prawns, many times to investigate the prawn trade, and what I discovered is so horrifying I will never eat another king prawn again. Every aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the prawn farms that pollute the oceans. Welcome to the rotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the prawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the so-called ‘trash fish’ on which the prawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake. I began my investigation aboard the trawlers that plunder the seas to provide the feed for the prawn farms along Thailand’s shoreline. While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Burma and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, even killed by unscrupulous skippers. These men suffer appalling treatment — some even dying on ship and having their bodies tossed casually overboard — just so we can taste king prawns in a lunchtime sandwich or Friday night curry. The damage to our oceans is also devastating. Watching a haul of trash fish being . pulled over the side of a Thai fishing boat is a heart-breaking sight: a . muddy mess of seaweed and rocks mixed with a vast variety of small or . juvenile sea creatures: crabs, starfish, sponges and small fish that . will not get the chance to grow any bigger. 'Horrifying': Jim Wickens says that now he has seen Thailand's king prawn trade first hand, he will never eat a one again . It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats. My technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one. More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to ‘rescue’ me. From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grisly industry operates at first hand. Every few hours, a whistle would sound and a net would be hauled up from the depths, raised above the deck and, on a signal from the captain, the contents spilled out. Panicked marine creatures including sea snakes, baby octopus, sea horses, puffer fish and pretty pink crabs would scurry across the deck, only to be crushed underfoot and shovelled up into a heap before being thrown into the hold. These trawlermen employ one of the most environmentally damaging forms of commercial fishing to be found anywhere in the world: bottom trawling. This practice, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive. Entire tranches of marine life are effectively swept away and habitats and ecosystems that might have been there for centuries are destroyed. Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed and with them the futures of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom trawlers, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades. But no longer. Back on deck, the often enslaved crews, who are tricked into coming to Thailand by the false promise of generous wages, are woken by the deafening blare of an air horn mounted above their cramped sleeping quarters. Exhausted, but too frightened to disobey an order, they stumble to the deck to sort through the latest trash fish catch. It’s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side; everything else is shovelled into an already stinking hold. Many of these boats do have ice-controlled holds, but they are reserved for commercially valuable catches. The trash fish go straight into a filthy compartment where, with boats often at sea for days at a time, they soon start to rot. Damage: The Thai fishing trade leaves serious environmental damage in its wake and pollution in the ocean . By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable and there are regular reports of crewmen fainting and even dying after they’ve been sent into the holds to help with unloading, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes. These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trawler setting out. In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicides are common and murders not unknown. One crewman I spoke to had been shot at four times and had seen at least one crewmate killed. These desperate men are dying unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and family.Once the trawlers return to port, the commercially valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market. Putrid: The king prawns are fed on 'trash fish' It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trucks arrive. Time and again, I witnessed the boats’ stinking holds being unloaded and their rotting cargo shovelled into ten-tonne dumper trucks. From here, it is a very smelly ride to an industrial processing plant, where the feed destined for prawn farms is produced. It is produced amid swarms of flies, temperatures that can approach 38C and a sweltering humidity of 100 per cent. The stench is foul. Load upon load of putrid fish and decaying marine creatures is poured into fetid storage containers. Every now and then you spot the eye of a beautiful coral fish or the glint of a long-dead starfish as the noxious mess is crushed and passed through a series of ovens until the final product — fish flour — is obtained. Transformed into pellets, this is then driven to the prawn farms that have all but destroyed Thailand’s mangrove forests. If you’d driven down the coast of the Gulf of Thailand 20 or 30 years ago you’d have seen mile after mile of these flooded forests, an incredible breeding ground for fish and a natural barrier that protected Thai farmers and their land from tsunamis. Today, however, most of these forests are gone. In their place is mile after mile of prawn ponds, their valuable contents protected by high fencing and security lighting. In these ponds, prawns are farmed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe. In Britain, we consume about 85,000 tonnes of prawns a year, two-thirds of which are warm-water prawns like those farmed in Thailand. The trade is worth £450 million in Britain alone. Prawns need brackish, slightly salty water, which is why former mangrove forests that have been cleared of their trees and cut off by sluices from the sea are ideal. But prawns also need feeding — a lot of feeding. Spend a day peering through one of those security fences and you’ll see men coming out every few hours to toss another bucket of ‘feed’ to the growing prawns. I watched from the side of one prawn pond as they prepared to harvest the fattened prawns. The sluices were opened and the prawns caught in a filter as the water drained out. They are beheaded and frozen in minutes but, in many cases, the filthy lagoon water, a grim cocktail of several months’ worth of excreta and food waste, is simply washed out into what’s left of the surrounding mangrove forests or straight out to sea. Concerned about Thailand: In Hugh's Fish Fight, TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall went to examine farmed King Prawns, at Asia's biggest prawn market near Bangkok . Thailand does have marine conservation laws designed to protect both its coastal waters and specially designated marine conservation reserves. But these are poorly policed and routinely ignored by ruthless commercial fishing fleets whose only concern is short-term profit at any cost. Meanwhile, thousands of miles from this marine destruction, we unthinkingly bite into a delicious skewer of tiger prawns, perhaps coated with garlic butter. But what are the alternatives to industrially produced prawns? Some certification schemes for so-called ‘responsibly produced’ prawns do exist, and marginal improvements to farming practices are beginning to take place. But in my research I have found that none of the certification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing. King prawns can also be produced organically. Naturally, this makes them very expensive for supermarket customers. But even organic prawn farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forest — even if trash fishing has been avoided. As consumers, however, we can look elsewhere. There are cold-water prawns from the North Atlantic, which currently account for about one-third of all prawns eaten in this country. Dublin Bay prawns from the Irish Sea  — most of which are currently exported to France as langoustine — are another alternative. Neither, however, is currently available as cheaply or conveniently as Thailand’s tiger prawns. The only answer, I believe, is to stop eating warm-water king prawns altogether. I, for one, don’t want slave labour and the destruction of the ocean mixed in with my prawn cocktail. Do you?","'I'll never eat a king prawn again' says Wickens after seeing Thai prawn trade .

John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UW-Madison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced.

The report alleges that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There was beer and mixed drinks at that party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. As the party was ending, Chadima asked one student to stay behind and have a drink with him. The two each had three rum drinks. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Doe.

001fb4ca3bd3a0c1cd91fdc813f0ebeeac678e76,"(CNN) -- Returning home from the London 2012 Paralympic Games, I discovered the level of U.S. media coverage for a global sports event. Ten days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five-and-a-half hours of coverage. To think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympic Games in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans didn't even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four-and-a-half years ago I was like most Americans and didn't know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I didn't so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann . Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices . I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? How many households are aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the Games, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You couldn't turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. So it is a weird feeling being back home. Four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four-and-a-half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 Games. Overcoming adversity . I will be honest, coming home from London isn't what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the Games' most successful athlete; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. As I got on the plane to return to Minnesota I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. What I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the ups and the downs, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four-and-a-half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. We have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they don't go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life doesn't go according to a plan. We can map it out, we can plan it, we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. My life this past month had a plan of its own. It didn't matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it didn't matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close the plan I had envisioned wasn't the plan that life had for me. Bubble . Over these past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was reclassified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. As I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do different next time. What can I change in my preparations over these next four years before the Rio 2016 Games? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. We were away from the real world in many ways. We didn't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was. Most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phones didn't work internationally. But then we return home and real life hits. You no longer are completely focused on competition; you are no longer surrounded by other athletes in the bubble. You are home.","Swimmer Mallory Weggemann won gold in the women's S8 50m freestyle .

0020ede07ee7ad1f6cf654c7dc678e7341d0c0e5,"(CNN) -- British innovator James Dyson, who has built a multi-billion dollar empire around his distinctive vacuum cleaners, has described patent laws across Europe as ""absolute madness"", saying they are unhelpful for inventors and small businesses. Dyson told CNN he wants the patent system in Europe radically overhauled. Over the last four decades, Dyson said, he has been affected enormously by people copying his ideas. Government leaders are continuously telling businesses that innovation drives the economy. But Dyson points to the red tape surrounding the patenting process as being a massive hurdle for businesses wanting to develop ideas. ""The problem with inventing: as soon as you file a patent they see what you are doing and they can see ways to get around it,"" said Dyson, who made his fortune inventing a bagless vacuum. The 64-year-old is an outspoken critic of Chinese counterfeiters, calling on governments to do more to protect intellectual property rights. Problems can arise because of the wording of the patents, Dyson said. ""There are no diagrams or drawings and often something hinges on the particular phrasing of the patent."" According to Dyson, if it is obvious someone has copied another person's ideas they should be dealt with without the parties going through a protracted legal battle. ""There shouldn't be this endless rigmarole of 'could this have been devised by one skilled in the art?'"" Because the current system involves many expenses due to varying jurisdictions throughout the continent, a Europe-wide patent is the answer, according to Dyson. ""You have to file in each country, you have to translate in each country, sue in each country, renews in each country -- it's seen as a profit center for each country."" Issues surrounding plagiarism are not limited to businesses, with consumers also feeling the impact of the high cost of producing and securing new inventions, Dyson said. Energy-saving and cost effective products and technology won't be created because of the enormous upfront investment it takes to develop them, he said ""It's anticompetitive to make copying easy.""

00211175819295755ed12e89791b4d543442981a,"(CNN) -- While the Tour de France ambles around the French countryside a dark shadow still lingers over the sport's blue ribbon event. While the PR machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion, cycling's attempt to lift the specter of Lance Armstrong still remains. A man who 'won' the Tour de France on seven occasions brought the sport to its knees last January after finally admitting he doped following years of denying the allegations. Earlier this year, Armstrong revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone which is naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. His seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was doping -- while the U.S. Anti-Doping agency (USADA) accused Armstrong of running ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Now, the Union Cycliste International (UCI), the sport's governing body and its president Pat McQuaid are under pressure to revamp cycling's entire image. But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck -- despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame. ""I'll look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because the system wasn't strong enough to beat him,"" McQuaid told CNN ahead of the start of the Tour. ""It wasn't a question of authorities, because many authorities tried to catch him and weren't able to, so I don't blame the UCI. I don't blame the AFLD (French anti-doping agency) or USADA or anyone else. ""The system wasn't strong enough and they were using products that couldn't be caught with the system. ""The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it's not just Lance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it."" Disillusioned . However McQuaid's position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him. Cycling Ireland refused to back its home candidate for September's UCI elections, while a recent management committee meeting in Bergen, Norway, was a fiery affair. A dossier compiled by private investigators on McQuaid was reportedly put forward to the committee with the Irishman blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting. The document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public, it represented another blow to McQuaid's re-election hopes. While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong's activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a hugely detrimental report from the USADA last October. The report raised question marks over whether the UCI had a role in covering up positive tests -- an allegation which McQuaid strenuously denies. When pushed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: ""No. Absolutely not."" After being quizzed on how he could be sure, McQuaid added: ""Because we know, we've studied, we know what we've done and we know, we have looked into all of this even since. ""We have prepared, we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you've asked there are all answered in those files. ""I think he (Armstrong) was tested 10-15 times during the Tour de France. So we did all we could do. Those samples were sent away and they came back negative. ""The UCI wasn't the only anti-doping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. ""I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn't strong enough and it wasn't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better."" But McQuaid is facing a challenge for the leadership from British cycling chief Brian Cookson, who has grown disillusioned with the Irishman's tenure. It follows a catalog of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,000 donation from Armstrong in 2002 -- four years before McQuaid took up his role. The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraption which is used to analyze blood samples. It is a decision which McQuaid concedes should not have been made. ""I would say and we have said, we have admitted that in hindsight -- and of course hindsight is an exact science -- that it would have been better had we not accepted those,"" he said. ""But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to."" Cookson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization. He has promised to create a completely new independent anti-doping unit, which would work alongside the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Cheats . McQuaid, who is aiming to secure a third term in office, remains philosophical about the future and the battle against doping. ""Nobody is silly enough to say that you're 100% confident that the peleton is 100% clean,"" added the UCI president. ""That's just not possible. It's not going to be possible in any sport or in any parts of society, but certainly I think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers, not wanting to get involved in doping. ""And there's evidence of many riders who come from strong teams, with strong anti-doping backgrounds all winning races and when they get across, you know, when they're doing their press conferences, they are saying I'm an example of how you can win a race clean . ""I don't think it'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats. ""There are people who look for a short-cut, who try to win by devious means or whatever. ""Whether it's cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion, there are always going to be people like that in society and in sport ."" There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though -- a route which involves Armstrong. The opportunity to talk to the disgraced cyclist in a bid to improve doping control remains a possibility -- and McQuaid is refusing to rule out such a move. ""He certainly has more knowledge,"" he said of Armstrong. ""If he was prepared, in terms of coming to the UCI, not necessarily to me and explain in more detail or give us more assistance, give us more information and try to help us in planning the future on the fight against doping, we'd certainly be interested in speaking to him.""","Chris Froome is current leader of Tour de France .

002124147bd10996f410d1a117ddf298018dbced,"(CNN) -- After weeks of relative calm, clashes erupted between supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and Egyptian security forces and local residents in several areas in Cairo, state media outlets reported. Additonally, pro-Morsy and anti-Morsy protesters clashed in other Egyptian cities. Three people died and 23 were hurt in Zeitoun, in western Cairo, and one person was killed and 17 injured in Manial in central Cairo, according to state media. The violence came during a pro-Morsy march in Cairo. Since Morsy's ouster and detention in July, his supporters have taken to the streets most Fridays. His supporters were unable to reach Tahrir Square and the presidential palace, according to state-run Al-Ahram. Morsy's son: 'Dad, you are the legitimate leader' Compared with violence in August that claimed hundreds of lives, the latest clashes appeared almost minor. On Friday, an anti-Morsy politician was stabbed in Cairo. It wasn't clear whether the attack was tied to the protests. State media reported that Khaled Dawoud sustained stab wounds to his chest and hand. Dawoud resigned from the government in August in protest of the bloody crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The unrest came amid reports on state media concerning the fate of 170 imprisoned members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nile TV reported that this group, including a former governor, will be held for 15 more days for further investigation. It was not clear how long this group had been held or on what charges. Since July, arrests and violence have been commonplace. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations last week, Egypt's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring. He also argued that the political process is open to all ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them.""

But in fact this giant jellyfish is harmless to humans – and a long way from home. Usually found in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean, the creature was spotted by wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella in Portland, Dorset, and is one of ten seen recently along the south coast. Experts say there could be an influx of these barrel jellyfish – up to 3ft 2in in diameter – over the next few months due to warmer weather. 'Invasion': The latest in a string of barrel jellyfish sightings has been reported on a beach in Portland, Dorset. Above, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella poses with the enormous creature, measuring 3ft in diameter . Richard Harrington of the Marine . Conservation Society said: ‘Although this species is harmless … we still . advise the public not to touch them.’ It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on the island by dog walker Suzanne Sheldon. Following her discovery, Ms Sheldon, 47, said: 'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I had ever seen.' Experts have warned that there could be an influx of the sea creatures as the weather warms up. Enormous: Experts have warned that we could see an influx of the sea creatures as temperatures soar to 20C toward the end of May. Above, the jellyfish which was spotted by the 49-year-old photographer, from Wareham . Washed up: Mr Trewhella believes the huge creature was washed ashore during strong winds and high tides . Forecasters expect high pressure to take hold later in May - sending temperatures soaring above 20C. In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the South Coast. High numbers: In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the south coast. Left, the jellyfish spotted by Mr Trewhella and, right, local Julie Hatcher poses with another jellyfish . Mr Harrington added: 'This is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but we still advise the public not to touch them.' But Mr Trewhella believes the creatures have come ashore because of strong winds and high tides. 'It's not that unusual to see jellyfish, they aren't particularly common in Dorset but we do see them every once in a while,' said the photographer. 'Jellyfish are a form of plankton, and the warm weather means we might see an increase in the levels of plankton. Another finding: It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on a beach in Portland . 'This is something that occurs around this time every year and it is known as the plankton boom. 'However, it is not the warm weather that causes jellyfish to wash up, instead it's the wind and tides that leave them stranded on beaches. 'I think we will see more strandings because of the on-shore winds and the tides, but people should be careful not to touch them.' 'Very bulky': Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was 'at least three foot in width' Barrel jellyfish - Rhizostoma pulmo in Latin - are often known as dustbin-lid jellyfish because of their enormous size. They are commonly found in the north east Atlantic, Adriatic, and Mediterranean sea and are prey to leatherback turtles.

The children’s immunisation service, babyjabs.co.uk, claimed experts believe the vaccine 'could be causing autism in up to 10% of . autistic children in the UK'. It also said: 'Most experts now agree that the . large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but . also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.' The babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an 'informed choice' about child vaccinations . It added that parental fears the jab caused autism . were 'supported' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had . been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children. However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism. The ASA ruled: 'Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the ‘real increase in the number of children with autism’ was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase.' They added: 'Because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case, and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.' BabyJabs Ltd denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded: 'We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated'. But the ASA said: 'The Cochrane review, looking at the general evidence available, could find no significant association between MMR immunisation and autism. 'We noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism, but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the MMR vaccine.' They added: 'We considered that consumers would understand from the (advert) that the MMR vaccine was likely to have caused autism in up to 10% of autistic children in the UK, namely between 300 and 400 children a year. 'We noted we had not seen any evidence, such as a clinical trial or study, which actively showed that the MMR vaccine was likely to cause autism in between 300 and 400 children a year.

The Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved in a week since getting stuck in unusually thick ice on Christmas. The people on board say they are holding up fairly well. ""The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,"" said Alok Jha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360. ""There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other."" Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes, Jha and Turney said. Turney said it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airlift, but rescuers must wait for conditions to improve. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter, which can transport 12 people each trip, will take the ship's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. ""People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,"" Turney told CNN. ""It's New Year's Eve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans."" That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Jha said. And there may be good spirits -- both emotional and alcoholic, Jha and Turney said. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers said it wasn't a bad place to be stuck. The scenery is beautiful. Penguins have been walking up to the ship and sniffing around, checking out their new neighbors. Close, but no rescue . The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the trapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer  because of the ice. It returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority.","Passengers preparing for New Year's Eve festivities .

00237a1d4477c976ee17d82d438e2650e0bff9a9,"It is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child: breastfeeding. So lesbian partners Heidi and Maryellen Olson wanted to share that with their first-born Sequoia. They both nurse their one-month-old daughter. Phenomenon: Maryellen Olson, 25, nurses her daughter Sequoia despite not giving birth . Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed 'co-nursing', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn't give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. 'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family's home in Santa Cruz, California. 'We both feel pretty amazed. 'It's amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi's due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started 'pumping' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman's body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called 'More Milk Special Blend' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. 'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. 'We get a lot of: ""Wow, that's amazing!"" and ""I didn't know that was possible!""' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor's sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. 'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,' Heidi said. 'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . 'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn't have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn ('she really makes us work for it!'). 'We don't really have a set schedule or rotation,' Maryellen said. 'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.' 'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it's not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia's cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: 'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. 'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she's been out of the womb and I'm breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. 'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. 'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn't have were I not breastfeeding.'","Heidi and Maryellen Olson conceived first daughter using donor sperm .

0024a4404120db4544060c11050acaaae185f315,"(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home. Ahlittia North had been missing since Saturday morning. Her mother awoke to find her gone from their apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harvey. Late Tuesday night, authorities charged Matthew Flugence, the nephew of Ahlittia's stepfather, in the girl's death. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said Flugence, 20, often babysat for her. Flugence was arrested after he was spotted walking along a road in the area. He had a knife on him, Sheriff's Col. John Fortunato said. Witnesses told authorities that Ahlittia was a friendly, outgoing child who always wanted to be first at the door when the doorbell rang, Normand said. After she was reported missing Saturday, investigators spent all day combing her neighborhood, looking in alleys, Dumpsters and boarded-up fourplexes. They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again. That's when they found the girl's body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said. Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday -- but they still don't know when, he said. It's possible Ahlittia's body was placed there so the garbage trucks would take it away. Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings. Ahlittia suffered four stab wounds -- two to her neck, likely the fatal wounds, and two to the abdomen, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said. She also had bruises to the front and back of her head, shoulder, lower back, and lower extremities. Cvitanovich said were no obvious signs during an autopsy of sexual assault. Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said. Russell Flugence had information about the crime that he didn't come forward with, and he also had information implicating his brother, the sheriff added. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Police make an arrest .

Grandmother Barbara Challons, of Mosborough, South Yorkshire, bought the two two-seater armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store three years ago and says they have always had problems. The company have sent her several spare parts but after repeated complaints they finally called at her home to fix them. A furniture shop refused to repair  armchairs owned by Barbara Challons (pictured) - after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her medication . An inspector from Harveys asked her if she was on any medication and she replied 'yes'. The 79-year-old was later stunned to receive a letter saying the medication had caused her to sweat and 'contaminated' the £500 chairs - meaning staff could not repair them. Mrs Challons said: 'I'm upset about it. People will think I'm dirty and I'm not dirty. They will think my house is scruffy. 'What makes me so cross is that they're saying these chairs are greasy. I'm really hurt by what they've made me look. 'If they didn't want to fix the chairs, why couldn't they use a problem with the furniture as an excuse. 'Instead they've made a personal attack on me and my health. People will think ""what's wrong with her?""'

Barbara Challons bought the two two-seater armchairs from Harveys Furniture Store in Sheffield (pictured) three years ago and says they have always been plagued by problem . 'She does take high blood pressure tablets, this is unrepairable as now contaminated. 'The chairs are nearly three years old, this is from sweat through taking medication. No repair possible.' After receiving the letter Barbara showed it to her doctor who 'laughed at it' and described it as 'nonsense'. Widowed Mrs Challons, a retired auxiliary nurse, had applied for the chairs to be repaired by the shop. But the worker who visited her home asked her whether she was diabetic or on any blood pressure medication, to which she replied 'yes'. She said she later found this was used as a reason not to fix the chairs, which she said had been 'plagued with problems'. Mrs Challons added: 'It's a load of rubbish. To say my taking tablets damaged the chairs is unreal.' Mrs Challons said she had recently ordered two new armchairs, which are currently being handmade. She added: 'As soon as they arrive, I'm throwing these out. I can't wait to see the back of them.' Mrs Challons (pictured) was stunned to receive a letter saying the medication had caused her to sweat and 'contaminated' the £500 chairs - meaning staff couldn't repair them . The report (pictured) from the company's repair partner said there was 'no repair possible' Accompanying the report, Harveys said there was 'no manufacturing defect' and that she would need to pay an upholsterer to assess the chairs to challenge the decision. A spokesman from Harveys said: ‘Our Customer Service team have conducted a detailed review of Ms Challon’s concerns. 'Our technician carried out a thorough testing of the material and determined that, given the staining on the product, repairing it was not an option and also the age of the product, that we would not be prepared to offer any compensation. 'We do, however, appreciate that our technician could have handled the situation more sensitively.

'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed,' he said, according to The Daily Beast. 'It will be distributed.' The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie pulled it after the threats. That came after a series of embarrassing internal documents were made public, from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges. The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes . Actress Angelina Jolie was also ripped in some of the email exchanges with Amy Pascal, seen here together at a  Women in Entertainment Breakfast in L.A. She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond. Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra. Boies called the hacks 'a state sponsored criminal attack on an American corporation and its employees. Sony has been glad for the FBI's help in investigating the hack, and 'the rest of the government has got to get behind it and has got to figure out a way that we can protect our national security.' As Vox notes, one viable option to get the movie out would be Crackle, the streaming service that Sony already owns. However, Boies was unsure how viewers would finally be able to see the film. Sony cancelled The Interview's slated December 25 release last week after the hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it . 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. 'But it's going to be distributed.' Just this weekend, North Korea threatened more attacks against the U.S. government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Sony which cancelled the release of The Interview. Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The government - which was outraged by the film showing the assassination of leader Kim Jong Un - also claimed to have 'clear evidence' that the U.S. government engineered the project as a 'propaganda' attack against North Korea.

In a ranting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Korean authorities hit back in an escalating war of words in which they say they will 'blow up' the White House - while bizarrely continuing to deny they have anything to do with the cyber attacks on Sony.

With divorce fast becoming the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days. But as these letters reveal, one smitten couple found a love so strong it was able to endure even while they were separated during World War II. Not only that, it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until they both died in 2011, he aged 96 and she aged 92, within just three days of one another. How time passes: Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day 1941 while Frederick . was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps and stayed married for . the next 70 years . But, as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life, in death it was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise. After Frederick and Elizabeth Noble had passed relatives discovered they had kept 250 love letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards from each other. Their grandson, Dr Andrew Rowland, has taken them along to the Antique Roadshow TV program. In one extract read on tonight's show, Frederick writes: 'You are the most wonderful, marvellous, precious, beloved, lovable, . adoring, adorable, charming, divine and loving sweetheart wife that has . ever lived. 'Darling, come a little closer and let me whisper in . your darling ears, all these loving words, because they are meant for . you, my sweetheart.' The pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout World War II . The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea chest . The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Wingate, County Durham. Speaking about the letters, Fiona Bruce, the show's host, said: 'Theirs was a real love story. What struck me about the . letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages. 'They . reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love burned . even more brightly while they were forced apart by war.' Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day in 1941 while he was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps. He had volunteered for the Army in 1936 despite having been selected . as a professional footballer by Aston Villa and served in Afghanistan, . India, Burma, Ceylon and France. From these war-torn . countries he wrote the tear-jerking telegrams to his wife who was . nursing injured servicemen back home. After the war, . Elizabeth carried on her work as a nurse while Frederick became a miner . in the East Durham coalfield, before rising to the position of colliery overseer. During their long lives the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren and it was grandson who discovered the letters . Perhaps the most heart-wrenching messages were written when Frederick's leave was cancelled. He says: 'I'm very sorry my beloved, I can't get home. That's all I live for, . home and you. In another passage he adds: 'We both feel the same when I have to return from leave. I have to take a . firm hold of myself or I would never come back. 'I hate to see the back . of you as my bus or train pulls out because I know it will be weeks . before I set eyes on you again. It's terrible when we have to part - too . awful for words.' Showing a touch of humour, Frederick writes again to compliment his wife's skill in the kitchen: 'Darling, no matter what you think, I still say that you are a good cook . - so let's not have a small row. You know I wish that today I could . have sat down to one of your dinners.' Elizabeth's communication is more limited, as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret. In the letters she did write she talks about the home front, rationing, and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the main road near their house. Only a small selection of letter were taken to Antiques Roadshow for filming and the family are keeping the rest secret while they decide what to do with them . While the letters reveal a lot about the couple's marriage, the war and their incredible devotion to one another, only a small selection were taken along to the show's filming in North Yorkshire. The rest are being kept a secret while the family, made up of the couple's two daughters, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, decide what to do with them. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Dr Rowland revealed that towards the end of their lives the pair talked about not wanting to go on without each other. He said that the family were comforted in their sadness by the thought that, in the end, Elizabeth had only had to endure three days without her beloved other half. Frederick died peacefully on December 4th, 2011, and Elizabeth on December 7th.","Frederick and Elizabeth Noble married in 1941 while he was on leave .

0028e335e8d06f2bab786a15965621db28e2ba55,"(CNN) -- My mom was always sports mad -- my dad not so much. But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all doors for me. I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling white minority. So when the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three Test matches. I got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom. It was the ""flour bomb"" Test -- where a light aircraft flew over Auckland's Eden Park before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and anti-apartheid leaflets -- where I began to realize that other countries didn't like us. I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little. Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again. I was six at the time. They were right; I would next see these two teams play as a 17-year-old. First trip . My first trip to Cape Town's Newlands Cricket Ground was to watch Western Province play a domestic match. It must have been my mom's first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people. Confused, we sat down. A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed. I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was. We returned a couple of years later to watch my first ""Test"" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies. This time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment. I remember the hype and the excitement about this special day. I had seen the Windies in their warmup game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special. They had vicious fast bowlers and flamboyant batsmen. We got there early, along with thousands of others, just to watch the warmups. The excitement was tangible. I don't remember much about the games -- I remember more about the players. They were heroes to us. Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islanders from far, far away on our shores. We used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground, hunting their prized autographs. And their accents -- just too cool. Didn't see color . I know I didn't see the color. I don't think most kids did -- they were just cricketers. At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph. Somewhere there is footage of me congratulating Sylvester Clarke by patting his back. I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great bowler. While I had forgotten about it, listening to Franklyn Stephenson speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid's Coke. He obliged and we all simply went crazy. I realize the significance of that event now. Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can? Perhaps our parents would have flipped out, but this wasn't about color to us. Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were. Happy to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds. Branded a rebel . It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched ""Branded a rebel"" -- a CNN World Sport documentary which first screened last year. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. And while ""Branded a rebel"" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been titled ""Branded Heroes."" That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too. It's all about what side of the line you were sitting, I guess. On their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living. The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions. I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them. Could we have done more? Did we look after them well enough after the fact? It's a difficult one. These men didn't deserve it, no matter what choices they made. Society can be cruel. Strangled by hatred . It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return. They were strangled by such hatred in their home countries, and yet I wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me. I got to see ""real"" international cricket played at the ""highest"" level. I got to meet new cricketing greats. I got to bowl like Clarke, Collis King and Colin Croft. I got to emulate David Murray's great wicketkeeping skills on Clifton beach, field like Alvin Kallicharan and admire the patience and masterful batting of the great Lawrence Rowe. And something else -- they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field. Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles. Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches. They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans. What I didn't understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside). They must have been scared -- really scared. I know I would have been. In the interview with Clive Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime. I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to South Africa. Courage . It's not for me to judge, but those men were courageous. In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that. A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using ""white"" transport and stay in ""white"" areas. I remember asking my mom how that worked. She didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing. I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary. I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murray's thoughts, motives and reflective answers. There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason. As for those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep. Stephenson was just how I remember him. Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life. We got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Orange Free State. The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change of attitudes in South Africa. I don't know if they changed us as a society but I'd like to thing so, even if it was an indescribably fractured and dysfunctional society. And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that ""The Cosby Show"" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. Heart bleeds . ""Branded a rebel"" showed balanced reporting. I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well. Great players like Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Clive Rice also effectively served life bans for being, well, South African, and the program understood that. I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nine-year-old devoid of political allegiances and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world's best cricketers entertaining us on the world's most beautiful stage. Ultimately, I'd also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.","Sporting ban to campaign against apartheid in South Africa introduced in 1977 .

Some 42 per cent of those housed at Category A Whitemoor jail - and more than a quarter of those in London prisons - consider themselves to be of Islamic faith. Experts now fear large numbers are being radicalised on the inside, where they say the spread of Jihadist ideas is rife. Figures show more than a quarter of inmates in London jails are Muslim, with one Category A jail revealing 42 per cent of its convicts follow the Islamic faith . Whitemoor inmate Zia Al Haq, left, was jailed for 18 for planning bomb attacks in London while Nezar Hindawi, right, was handed a 45-year sentence for plotting to blow up a jet . A source at Cambridgeshire jail Whitemoor told the Sunday People: 'Whitemoor is now effectively run by Muslims, many of whom are Jihadis.' A 2012 probe into the jail branded it a 'Taliban recruiting ground' and said inmates were offered protection if they converted to the religion. Shadow Justice Minister Sadiq Khan claimed ministers are not doing enough to tackle the issue of radicalisation in prisons. He said: 'In jails like Whitemoor, the Chief Inspector is on record warning of the risks of radicalisation. The Government needs to wake up to his problem before it is too late.' Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan says too little is being done to tackle the problem at jails like Whitemoor .

002a083c3893b1fde734280b9eec28d428a02d2b,"(CNN) -- Palestinian journalists are finding reporting increasingly difficult in the face of the growing abuse toward them by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a report released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch. The report, ""No News is Good News: Abuses Against Journalists by Palestinian Security Forces,"" criticizes Palestinian Authority forces in the West Bank and Hamas security forces in Gaza, saying they are abusing local journalists and limiting press freedom in the Palestinian territories. The 35-page report focuses on seven incidents in the West Bank and two in Gaza, saying they are ""cases in which security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza."" Human Rights Watch cites a report issued by the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedom that says there was a 45% increase in the number of physical attacks, arrests, confiscation of equipment and limitation of movement in the year 2010. ""We respect the Human Rights Watch report and other human rights organizations in what they do on the ground, and we have the readiness to investigate each case,"" said Maj. Gen. Adnan Dmeiri, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services. But, he said, ""Why don't they consult us and ask us ... before publishing these reports?"" He said the security services will investigate and ""bring people to justice. The PA has no agenda to violate the rights of human beings and especially the rights of the journalists. We trust our justice system and the freedom of journalists is a priority of all things."" Most of the abuses against journalists are connected to the rift between Fatah, which controls the West Bank's Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, according to the report. Pro-Hamas journalists are targeted by the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and pro-Fatah journalists are targeted by the Hamas security in Gaza. The report stresses that the West Bank security forces have ""virtual impunity for serious human rights violations"" and states that the ""utter failure of the (Palestinian Authority) leadership to address the prevailing culture of impunity for such abuses suggests that they reflect government policy."" ""We don't accept the comparison between us and the militia in Gaza,"" Dmeiri said. He said his organization has no political agenda and ""we don't hold and detain people on their background. We detain people if they have criminal or security threats or matters that threaten the internal security."" Large sums are donated to the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank by the United States and the European Union. Human Rights Watch calls on the donor countries to condition their support to those security services by making sure that Palestinian Authority officials investigate and punish security personnel for their abuses. Attacks on International journalists in Gaza also have increased in the past couple of months. In March 2011, as journalists were covering a demonstration in Gaza calling for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, the offices of Reuters, CNN and NHK were raided by Hamas security forces. Efforts to get a response from Hamas officials were not immediately successful. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association released a statement expressing its ""grave concern"" that Hamas security forces ""brutally attacked photographers and cameramen, beating them, breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage."" The organization called the developments the latest in a ""string of chilling attacks on reporters in Gaza."" The United States and European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Human Rights Watch describes itself on its website as ""one of the world's leading independent organizations dedicated to defending and protecting human rights.""

002a48549068d7db596738c4f3fa2f5562372ab3,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blue-ribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New York's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. ""The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,"" former Sen. Bob Graham said. He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. ""Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,"" he said.  Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack » . The U.S. government ""needs to move more aggressively to limit"" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. ""The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,"" he said. ""It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,"" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons ""are more available,"" he said. ""Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms."" ""There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,"" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. ""Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,"" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn, who said that the ""risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding."" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. ""Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,"" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as ""the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism."" While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, ""the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas"" in Pakistan. The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorism in line with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, which compiled a report on the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation.

""My gang mates were the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. ""We were pressured to join."" He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has surged to an estimated 130,000 in the past 10 years, according to the Preda Foundation, a local human rights charity.

""Gang members are groomed in the slums as early as 9 years old,"" says Peñaflorida. ""They are all victims of poverty."" For the past 12 years, Peñaflorida and his team of teen volunteers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs, his Dynamic Teen Company recreates a school setting in unconventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. Peñaflorida knows firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Born into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. ""I will strive hard; I will do my best."" In high school, Peñaflorida faced a new set of challenges. Gang activity was rampant; they terrorized the student body, vandalized the school and inducted members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. ""I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street."" Peñaflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Teen Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Peñaflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give kids the education he felt they deserved. ""They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave to me,"" he says.

A man went berserk and stabbed his fiancée because of the stress of trying to win a £25,000 ‘dream wedding’ contest, a court heard yesterday. Lee Rowlands and Madelaine Moir, both 37, were one of five couples in the competition final who were attempting to win the prize by raising the most money for charity in a week. They were working 20 hours a day to try to raise the money when Rowlands suffered a ‘psychotic episode.’ He allegedly began hearing voices and attacked Miss Moir with two kitchen knives as she cowered on the floor. Strain: Lee Rowlands, right, and his fiancée Madelaine Moir, he he attacked with two kitchen knives during a psychotic episode while desperately trying to win a radio competition for a 'Dream Wedding' She was wounded on her breast, arm, fingers and knee and he ran into the street believing he had killed her, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Yesterday Rowlands was jailed for 28 months after admitting unlawful wounding. He will be released in a few weeks because he has been in custody for 13 months and would have been automatically freed at the halfway point of his sentence. Miss Moir is said to have stood by him and they still hope to get married. The couple had been together for two years before the attack on March 14 last year. They entered the competition run by Sheffield-based independent radio station Hallam FM in the hope of winning the £25,000 wedding package, including a honeymoon in Sri Lanka, venue hire, dress, flowers and photographer. In her application Miss Moir wrote: ‘We wish we had met years ago, we love each other and want to shout it to the world.’ Stand by your man: Miss Moir arrives at Sheffield Crown Court to see Rowlands sentenced. The pair still hope to marry one day . Alison Dorrell, prosecuting, said the couple had a happy relationship and Rowlands had become the father figure to the divorcee’s two children. But Miss Moir had noticed her partner’s heart beating irregularly and he began to speak about hearing voices. He also threatened to jump out of the window and harm himself. During the 25-minute ‘episode’ Rowlands attacked his fiancée with two kitchen knives at their home in Armthorpe, Doncaster. He then ran outside in his boxer shorts ‘saying he had killed her’. Rowlands was found by police sobbing in the street. Miss Dorrell said: ‘He was making no sense at all.’ Miss Moir needed hospital treatment and later had surgery on a finger injury. She said later she didn’t recognise the man who attacked her.  ‘He wasn’t himself and she was of the view that he didn’t want to hurt her and he wasn’t thinking rationally,’ said Miss Dorrell. Miss Moir wrote in her victim statement: ‘We never argued. This is why I can’t say what happened. It is as if somebody else had taken over his body.’ The court heard she had helped turn Rowlands’ life around. He had served time in jail, and they entered the wedding contest because he was desperate to prove himself. Richard Barradell, defending, said the couple aimed to raise £2,000 each a day to win the wedding prize. However, it became clear ‘things were getting to Lee Rowlands’. Mr Barradell said ‘something snapped’ and Rowlands had a ‘psychotic mental breakdown of rapid onset’. ‘He is desperately sorry for what he did. He can’t explain it.’ Judge Robert Moore said Rowlands had been receiving mental health treatment and his release in a few weeks under licence would enable him to continue his rehabilitation.

002c115c31577d0e9443794d27c2df51312858b4,"Washington (CNN) -- The pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots ""became distracted by a conversation"" about the airline's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said. The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U.S. military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft. According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency. The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is ""likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button. Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller."" The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. ""These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,"" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. ""The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,"" the board said. ""Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188."" The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain ""looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,"" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters. The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. ""Neither sector controller's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established"" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. ""Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,"" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as ""emergency"" or ""mayday"" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt. Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy."" But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing.","First officer didn't completely load radio frequency, NTSB says .

Brazilian student Roberto Curti, 21, died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, after a chase and violent struggle with police in Sydney's CBD in which he was tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on. Policemen Scott James Edmondson and Daniel David Barling have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm while Chin Aun Lim and Damian John Ralph face the charge of assault. All four have pleaded not guilty. Brazilian student Roberto Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on . A court heard on Monday that the four police officers involved used 'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful force' against Mr Curti . On the opening day of a four-week hearing, prosecutor Cate Dodds on Monday said Mr Curti became increasingly afraid and erratic after taking the drug LSD with two friends on the night of March 17, 2012. By the early hours of the morning, Mr Curti was seen running around the city before going to a convenience store and stealing two packets of Tim Tams. After a triple zero call, police initially described the biscuit theft over the radio as an armed robbery involving two men. Policemen Scott James Edmondson (left) and Daniel David Barling (right) pictured earlier this month have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mr Curti was eventually spotted by police who began chasing him along Pitt Street at about 6am. He was dressed in blue jeans and had no shirt and no shoes on. When police caught him, Ms Dodds said Lim successfully deployed his Taser at Mr Curti causing him to fall to the ground. What happened next, she said was 'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful'. As Mr Curti lay handcuffed on the ground, surrounded by cops, Lim discharged his Taser for a second time. Chin Aun Lim (left) and Damian John Ralph (right) face the charge of assault . Meanwhile Barling, the court heard, used the Taser's 'drive-stun mode' on five separate occasions, while Edmondson used his twice. Mr Curti was also hit with capsicum spray by Ralph, Ms Dodds said. The cause of Mr Curti's death is undetermined but he was unable to be resuscitated at the scene. The hearing continues on Tuesday. Earlier this month the four police officers were seeking to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them. In a hearing in the first week of November, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were now making an application to stay the proceedings against them. All four have pleaded not guilty and earlier this month were trying to halt all criminal proceedings against them . Barrister Bret Walker SC told the court, the prosecution case against the four police officer including Scott Edmondson (pictured) was 'rooted in an eradicable error' The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said. During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them. Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them. This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said. The hearing commenced on Monday and will run for the next four weeks.  Chin Aun Lim is pictured here a fortnight ago . But Crown Advocate Natalie Adams SC, appearing on behalf of the attorney-general, said only three pages of Lim's interview had ever been handed to the DPP. If the admissibility of the interviews was in question, Ms Adams said there should be an application for that evidence to be excluded. 'This is not a basis for a stay,' she said, adding that should be a 'last resort'. Magistrate Mark Buscombe will hand down his decision on the permanent stay application by the four police officers on November 11.

A wedding planner who stole £11,000 from couples marrying at one of Britain's top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer . Patricia Glancy, 36, conned five couples into leaving blank cheques with Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account. Although she admitted stealing the money, Glancy was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Thelma Harte on holiday to New York, as well as on large donations to cancer charities. Glancy stole a total of £10,787.50 pounds between March 1 and June 6 last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses. The scheme was was finally detected when a bride emailed the club about her wedding preparations - only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left. Judge Peter Moss, sitting at Guildford Crown Court today sentenced Glancy to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the weddings of all couples that fell victim to the scam. During the trial Judge Moss was handed 'proof' Glancy used to the cash to pay for a trip to New York for a friend, Thelma Harte, who was dying of cancer. Ms Harte is believed to have died before the scam was detected. Glancy also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf club’s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer hospices. 'Wentworth Golf Club picked up, as you would expect of a reputable organisation, the costs to fulfill their obligations that fell through because of your fraud. You risked damaging their reputation because of your actions,' said Judge Moss. 'You fully admitted this matter and I bear in mind you are 36 years of age and of good character. Suspended sentence: Patricia Glancy (pictured) was spared jail after it emerged she spent the stolen money taking a dying friend on holiday to New York, as well as making large donations to cancer charities . Money: Guildford Crown Court heard that Wentworth Golf Club (pictured) had honoured all the weddings for couples that found themselves conned out of thousands of pounds by Glancy . 'Your best friend was dying of cancer . and you wanted to provide trips for her to New York and you also . mentioned you had given donations to charity events for two particular . hospices, Judge Moss added. 'You certainly had . bought equipment from the professional shop - at a discount no doubt - . with some of the proceeds you had taken from your customers. 'I saw evidence you had been engaged in those charity events. It attracted, for you personally, a considerable amount of praise and admiration from family and friends. That may well have been the motivation for you.' Glancy, from Ascot in Berkshire, admitted five counts of fraud by false representation at an earlier court appearance. Judge Moss said her crimes deserved custodial punishment but decided to suspend her six-month prison sentence for 18 months. The judge told Glancy that she would immediately serve the six-month term if she committed any further crimes in the next 18 months. Scene: Patricia Glancy conned five couples into leaving blank cheques at the world-famous Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey (pictured). She would then deposit the cheques into her own bank account . He also ordered that she paid £350 pounds costs. Prosecutor Trina Little had earlier told the judge how Glancy worked at Wentworth Golf Club, near Virginia Water, Surrey, from January 16, 2012 to May 31 last year as club’s events sales manager. She said: 'She was tasked to arrange wedding receptions for people getting married at the club and liaised with the parties in doing so.' 'Miss Glancy was asking for deposits. On four of the counts the parties paid by cheques. They left them blank and she said she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp.' 'She completed her name and details.' One payment was made by bank transfer - but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, Glancy gave her own account number, the prosecutor said. Lisa Patel and Mo Maan had just under £1,940 pounds diverted without their knowledge. Lauren Sandford’s father wrote a cheque for £2,650 pounds as a deposit for his daughter’s wedding to Gary Kearton. Home: Guildford Crown Court heard Patricia Glancy had now repaid all the money she had stolen. Above, Glancy's home in Ascot, Berkshire . A further cheque for an almost identical sum for Daniella Field and Matt Joy’s reception failed to land in the club’s account. Then £1,239 pounds for Nikki Hitchmore and Hooverney Martinez’s big day was taken, before Nadine Maraj and Shiraz Sharif had just over £2,300 pounds vanish into Glancy’s account. The frauds, which were carried out between March 1 and June 6, 2013, were exposed by an investigation launched after Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email, only for a message to bounce back saying she had left the club. Wentworth honoured the payments to make sure the weddings went ahead as planned. Glancy’s defence counsel Robert Spencer-Bernard told the judge that his client was 'genuinely remorseful' and had paid back the full amount to Wentworth. The judge had deferred Glancy’s sentencing hearing last month to give her time to prove she had spent the money on charitable causes, and to repay the cash.","Patricia Glancy, 36, conned couples out of money at Wentworth Golf Club .

Nicknamed the Atkins Gene in some quarters after the popular diet, its official scientific nickname is AMY1. The gene makes an enzyme that is found in saliva and begins the breakdown and digestion of starchy foods like chips, crisps and rice. Carbohydrates: Researchers have found that a gene that makes an enzyme found in saliva begins the breakdown of starchy food and can have a large influence on weight . The study showed that people who had more copies of the gene made more of the enzyme and were more likely to be slim. Although we normally think of genes as coming in pairs, some people will only have one copy of a gene.  Others will have two, three or even more. In the case of the AMY1 gene, it possible to have up to 20 copies. Those who had fewer copies would be likely to find carbohydrates more difficult to digest - and therefore more likely to put on weight the journal Nature Genetics reports. Nickname: The AMY1 gene has been nicknamed the Atkins Gene after the popular diet devised by Dr Robert Atkins (pictured) It is not clear why.  But one possibility is that the undigested starch is feasted on by gut bacteria that fuel obesity by tinkering with the metabolism. The researchers, from King’s College London and Imperial College London, said that future dietary advice may have to be tailored to a person’s digestive system. Professor Tim Spector, the study’s joint lead author, said: ‘These findings are very exciting. ‘The next step is to find out more about the activity of this digestive enzyme and whether this might prove a useful marker or target for the treatment of obesity. ‘In the future, a simple blood or saliva test might be used to measure levels of key enzymes such as amylase in the body and therefore shape dietary advice for both overweight and underweight people. ‘Treatments are a long way away but this is an important step in realising that all of us digest and metabolise food differently – and we can move away from ‘one-size fits all diets’ to more personalised approaches.'","AMY1 gene makes a carb-busting compound and can influence weight .

Historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen World War One soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in France in 1914. The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20. It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009. Now, his great-nephew Eric Saunders, 61, . from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with . one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative. Eric Saunders has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, belongs to his great uncle . Private Frederick Thompson (left and right, with his wife) was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20. Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, in 2009 . And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on. The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death . Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Mr Saunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. 'I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. 'I have grandchildren that age myself, and I can’t even begin to imagine what those soldier’s poor mothers went through. 'I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. 'I didn’t really know anything about my mother’s side of the family. We were both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time. The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields. The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium . In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving. The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place. 'I was very keen to give a DNA sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes. 'I’ve . been told it may take several months to come back with a result, but I . hope I can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve. 'I’ve said that I would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men, even if it turns out not to be my uncle’s remains. I feel as though I have a bond with those men now.' The 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment had been based in Ireland at the outbreak of the war, landing in France on September 9, 1914, and taking part in the Battle of Armentihres. The battalion then headed to fight with the 6th Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31. All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014. An MOD spokesman said: 'The use of DNA can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered, but after many decades results may be inconclusive. We always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility. 'DNA testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases. 'The JCCC Historic Casework team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of British Service Personnel are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago.'

David Lee Collins, 18, from London, was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub in the popular resort of Ayia Napa last November. The court said that Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman, originally from Somalia, but living in London, was provoked and 'lost . self-control' when he pulled out a switchblade and fatally stabbed Mr Collins. Tragic: David Lee Collins, 19, was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub in the popular resort of Ayia Napa last November - the photo on the right is thought to be last image taken of him before his death . The three-judge bench said that Collins had confronted Osman and his friends after being punched by an unidentified nightclub patron, raising a clenched fist at the group and telling them 'Are you bad men?' - a phrase which the court said is interpreted in Britain as a challenge to a fight. The court said that it was a group of friends with Collins - all of whom were soldiers - that started the fight. The court also took into account that there was no premeditation on 19-year-old Osman's part since he didn't previously know the victim, had fully cooperated with investigators and had apologised to the victim's family. Sentenced: Mohammed Abdulkadir Osman, 20, originally from Somalia but believed to have been living in London, admitted manslaughter at a court hearing in Larnaca on April 22 and returned for sentencin . David Collins' mother Lisa Minott, arrived at  the court in Larnaca, Cypru  clutching a large handbag with a painted portrait of her son . But it discounted Osman's consumption . of alcohol as a mitigating factor and noted the fact that he had the . switchblade on him inside the club 'carried the possibility of harm . being caused.' Police searching Osman's hotel room . at the time turned up marijuana, two brass knuckles and 11 switchblades . that the defendant said he bought from a local store as souvenirs to . take back home and give to friends. Charges against two other teenagers, who were both 17 at the time of the stabbing, were dropped. Mr Collins, from the 2nd Battalion, . Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died from a 'ruptured heart caused by a . sharp instrument', according to a post-mortem.

He was stationed at the British Army base at Dhekelia but was due to fly to Afghanistan the day before he died and his battalion's mission was delayed. Mr Collins' mother Lisa Minott and her sister - along with members of his regiment - were in court to hear the sentencing. MoD spokeswoman . Connie Pierce said the attack took place in an area of the eastern . Mediterranean island that British soldiers are told to avoid because of . previous incidents. After the rape and murder of Danish tour guide Louise Jensen by British servicemen in 1994, the centre of Ayia Napa - a clubbing resort with a reputation for sex, drugs and violence - was declared off limits to soldiers by military top brass on the island.

The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion. Virginia scientists claim the fossils are too complex to be bacteria, and may instead be the embryos of an ancient unidentified creatures. Spherical fossils in China dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet's earliest animals.The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion . Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils. Each fossil measures around 0.03 inches (0.7mm) across and originated from what could have been a marine environment at the time. 'This opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the Earth in a very visible way,' said Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geobiology in the Virginia Tech College of Science. Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils . The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 540 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. 'Fossils similar to these have been interpreted as bacteria, single-cell eukaryotes, algae, and transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges, sea anemones, or bilaterally symmetrical animals. This paper lets us put aside some of those interpretations.' By cutting the rocks into extremely thin slicers, the scientists were able to shine a light through the fossils to see the formation inside, according to a report in LiveScience. Professor Xiao found patterns in the fossils that suggests cell-to-cell adhesion and programmed cell death - qualities found in the cell of animals and plants. The fossils could represent the shift between single-celled life and multicellular animals, Professor Xiao said. Professor Xiao is now hoping to find more Megasphaera, including fossils of the adult creatures that may have created the embryos. 'We will have to be open-minded in terms of what can be expected,' Professor Xiao told Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience. 'There are extinct animals or even offshoots of the lineages leading to animals that could be rather different from what we know as animals living today.'","Called Megasphaera, the fossils were found in rock in southern China .

A motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket. Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally . When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal's car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it reaching under to paint the lines. 'There were no lines there when I parked. I can't believe they've done it.' The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal's front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when. He said: 'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking. 'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn't.' A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car. David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: 'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error. 'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers. 'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'",They even sprayed paint on his Ford Fiesta in calamitous giveaway .

There will be no trains in or out of King’s Cross in London due to delays to Network Rail works north of the station. The disruption comes on one of the busiest travel days of the year, as thousands of people try to return home after visiting family for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Services in and out of London Kings Cross station have been cancelled today, it has been announced . Frustration: Travellers at the London station, one of the busiest in the country, where services are cancelled . The disruptions at the station, which is managed by Network Rail, will affect those planning to travel on East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern services. East Coast Trains made the announcement on its website yesterday evening, where it advised passengers to delay their travel if possible. It also said that a revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Customers have been advised they need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train because of the overrun works in the Holloway area. A reduced service to and from the station will go ahead as planned on Sunday, with trains  leaving up to 20 minutes earlier than normal from King's Cross. Last night Passenger Focus, the independent watchdog, described the delays as ‘frustrating’. East Coast made the announcement on their website and apologised for disruption on what is 'an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break' They follow years of complaints from passengers that Britain’s railways effectively ‘shut down’ over the Christmas and New Year holiday. The chaos is heightened by the fact that the West Coast Main Line is already closed for engineering works over the Christmas period. The route is shut between London Euston and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire until Monday, and also closed between Stafford and Crewe until Sunday. Last night travellers vented their frustration with the King’s Cross closure on social media, saying Network Rail had ‘explaining to do’. The station is the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, which provides services to major cities including Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh. East Coast spokesman, Paul Emberley, said: 'Network Rail has apologised to passengers for the inevitable delays to their travel plans on Saturday as a result of the overrunning engineering works. 'East Coast is particularly sorry too for the inconvenience to its customers as a result, on what we know is an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break. Sources said that the station would effectively be closed  due to delays to works north of the station . 'For customers intending to start or finish their journey at King's Cross, consideration should be given to deferring travel plans to either Sunday or Monday. 'We're working hard over the holiday period to make the necessary adjustments to our timetable as a consequence, and to provide as much information as we can.' National Rail said on its website that services to and from King's Cross would be 'significantly disrupted' tomorrow. It said there will be no trains before 10am tomorrow and over the weekend, many trains will start or terminate at Doncaster, Peterborough, Stevenage or Finsbury Park. Meanwhile, First Hull Trains will run two trains in each direction each day to and from London St Pancras International instead of London Kings Cross. Great Northern are diverting some trains to and from Moorgate between 8.30am and 7.30pm. It said:  'A revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Please check our website regularly for updates. 'Passengers travelling to and from central London may use London Underground services between Finsbury Park and central London. Customers will need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train, according to East Coast Trains . 'Buses will run between London Kings Cross and Finsbury Park when there is no train or London Underground service.' The rail company said that the work was part of a £200 million Christmas investment programme. It is one of 300 projects being undertaken over the holidays across 2,000 sites up and down the country by some 11,000 railway engineers. A spokesman said: 'What has happened is really regrettable and unfortunate, but it is a small part of a massive amount of engineering investment taking place over Christmas.' The spokesman added that 4.5 million passengers use the railways on average every day, compared with two million a day over the holidays. The company confirmed the disruption at around 8.30pm on its Twitter page - hours after it was first announced by East Coast Trains, which said: 'No service between Kings Cross & Finsbury Park tom due to track work in the Holloway area which has taken longer then expected. Apologies.' Hundreds were forced to take to the roads yesterday after rail services were virtually non-existent today . A reduced service will also operate to and from the terminal on Sunday as planned, with journeys possibly being re-timed or taking longer than expected, according to Network Rail. David Sidebottom, passenger director at the independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Investment in maintenance and improvement is necessary, and we passengers understand that. 'But overrunning works that disrupt already-limited festive travel are frustrating. 'Our research is clear: passengers want to be kept on the train wherever possible, they want to know before buying a ticket if part of the journey will be by bus, and they want plenty of staff on hand to signpost where to go and what to do. 'We will be looking to see that operators and Network Rail are doing all in their power to alert passengers, to help them make alternative arrangements and to make it easy for them to claim refunds or compensation.' Several frustrated passengers have taken to Twitter to vent their anger. Liam Gladdy said: 'Something must have gone very, very wrong for @networkrail at Kings Cross if they're looking at overrunning by 2 days for 2 days work.' While Amelie Soleil wrote: 'Ahhh what's that? All trains are cancelled coming though Kings Cross tomorrow. Brilliant. Nice to see that £200 train ticket was worth it.' Emily Clifton said: 'Trains all cancelled from King's Cross tomorrow literally what am i supposed to do,' while another user said 'The UK are so unprepared. Today it's just like 'Oh, by the way, we're closing King's Cross for a few days.' It comes after a day of travel disruption on the railways as every single major artery in Britain was closed on Boxing Day. Trains between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines - and the Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia lines remained shut yesterday. The near-non-existent Boxing Day service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the shutdown dating back to at least 2007. Labour and Tories have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service, which affects football fans, families without cars and shop workers in the Boxing Day sales. Apart from airport shuttles and Eurostar, only Chiltern, Scotrail, Southeastern and Southern ran trains yesterday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open during the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where lines are closed.’","East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern lines hit .

A success story of African development, democracy and stability, Ghana is a nation made up of people that are as warm as its climate. Rich in history, culture and natural beauty, it's the perfect introduction to Africa if you are a first-time traveler to the continent, or a great alternative for those who have exhausted the Safari circuit, and crave a different African experience. There is something for everyone in Ghana, ranging from nature trails and UNESCO World Heritage sites to bustling markets, tranquil beaches and vibrant nightlife. Wildlife . There are 15 national parks and reserves across the country. A must see is Kakum National Park, in the central region. The area is covered with stunning tropical rainforest and rare animals, and a long series of hanging bridges known as the Canopy Walkway. Not for the faint hearted, the walkway is located at the forest canopy level, and is secured by a series of nets and wires for safety. The walkway provides tourists with a spectacular vantage point of the beautiful surroundings. Another great place to visit is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park. The park is located in northwest Ghana, and the park's entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga. It is home to over 93 mammal species, with large mammals including elephants, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for numerous antelope species; olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the green vervet are among the monkey species resident there. Slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles are among the 33 known species of reptiles that call this breathtaking park home. Read more: 26 of the most stunning spots in Africa . Heritage . The country became a major economic hub with the emergence of the slave trade, and several slave castles erected by the Europeans in 15th century remain standing. Built by the Portuguese in 1482, Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has become a pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors from around the world -- in particular African-Americans and Caribbean people seeking to connect with their heritage. The town of Elmina surrounding the castle is a vibrant, robust fishing community with an incredible amount of energy and color. Accra . If you don't want to venture far from the capital, there is a lot to do right in Accra. For beach bums, Labadi beach is perfect for soaking up the African sun, and being entertained while you do it. Drumming, cultural dancing and music can all be seen and heard on holidays and during the weekend. Tourists can also visit local cultural attractions such as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, W.E.B Dubois Center or head to the Arts Center, where a multitude of stalls sell crafts from all around the country. After a day of relaxing at the beach or visiting the cultural sites, visitors can head to the upscale area of Osu, in central Accra, to sample the nightlife. Locally referred to as the ""West End,"" Osu boasts an impressive number of local and international restaurants offering a range of cuisines. There are also several options for club hoppers and lounge goers. One of the latest additions to nightlife in Accra is Republic Bar and Grill. With indoor and outdoor seating the bar has a retro vibe, and celebrates Ghanaian food, music, culture and art. Republic has a wonderful list of drinks, ranging from cold local beers, to exotic cocktails and herbal teas made with fresh ingredients. The bar also serves a wonderful menu of finger foods including fried yam/cassava, kelewele (fried plantain seasoned with delicious spices) and chicken wings seasoned with local spices.

00377ab9d3caafb18464c47d0535ae2781aeef15,"(CNN) -- Two separate incidents at coal mines in Southwest China over the weekend left at least three miners dead and 42 trapped, state media reported. Days of heavy rain caused a mine at Niupeng in Guizhou province to flood on Saturday morning; while ""rain-saturated earth on the surface collapsed into a shaft"" at another pit in Guangxi around noon the same day, killing three miners, Xinhua said. The report added that more than 1,000 police, firemen, and paramilitary personnel joined the mission to rescue the trapped workers at Niupeng. By Monday the water level at the mine had dropped but was still 40 meters (131ft) higher than where 23 of the miners are believed trapped, according to reports from China National Radio. Local authorities said the heavy rain may have caused a previously dry river to rise, while possibly increasing the water level in underground rivers around the mines. According to Xinhua, the Niupeng mine's investors have already been detained by the police. At Guangxi, high concentrations of gas prevented workers from using machines to dig out another 19 trapped miners trapped at a depth of 390 meters (1,200ft), China Daily said. 50 other miners were reported to have escaped the cave-in. Continued rain on Sunday further complicated the rescue effort, it added. ""The rescue team is only equipped with shovels and rail track cars"", Meng Qingguan, head of the Heshan Work Safety Bureau, told CCTV on Saturday. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, as very few of the mines follow the government's safety regulations. According to the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS), almost 2,500 miners were killed in mine accidents in 2010. However, the head of SACMS, Zhao Tiechui, said Tuesday that the number of miners dead or missing from accidents had decreased by 35% from last year, with just 807 dead so far in 2011. Michele Philips contributed to this report.","42 miners remain trapped in the two coal mines in southwestern China .

While helipads, waterslides, and movie theatres are commonplace additions to the yachts of the super wealthy, a stylish Italian vessel is making waves for being the first  to feature a floating drive-in garage. J'ade, by Ferretti group company CRN, features a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water. Scroll down for video . Innovative: The 196-foot yacht has a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water . Floating fortress: While swimming pools and helipads are commonplace on many a mega yacht, J'ade features the world's first floating garage . Glide in: The internal basin floods and empties 18,000 litres of water in just three minutes, allowing the boat to enter the yacht without the use of a crane . The internal basin, which holds 18,000 litres of water, floods and empties in just three minutes, enabling the boat (a 27ft Riva Iseo) to enter the yacht without using a crane. When the speedboat is not being stored inside, the basin can also be utilised as an indoor ocean pool, accessible from the lower-deck terrace. Completed last year, the 60-metre yacht was the star attraction at last week's Monaco Yacht Show, where it was a finalist  for the Best Interior award, only to miss out on the prize to the brand-new Perini Navi motor yacht Grace E. J'ade made its debut at the annual yacht show last year, and also won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show. Honey, I'm home: The one-of-a-kind  garage enables the owner to access the yacht from their speed boat internally, via the vessel's plush lower deck . Multi-purpose: When the speedboat is not being stored, the basin can also be used as an internal ocean pool, located just behind this luxury terrace . Beauty: The vessel won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show and was nominated for Best Interior at the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show . The privately-owned yacht was created by Studio Zuccon International Project, and is designed to feel 'at one with the sea'. The 196-foot vessel can comfortable accommodate 10 guests in four cabins and the owner suite, and 13 crew members. Aside from the impressive 'garage', J'ade also features a gymnasium, hammam room and aquarium. Across the four decks, materials for the interiors are Canaletto walnut and polished rosewood. The hardwood floors are made of wide Afromosia strips and the cabins and owner suite are fitted with white Tai Ping carpets. There are jade green accents throughout the interior. A life of luxury: Guests on board the J'Ade can also soak up the sun on one of the vessel's comfy lounging areas, located across all four of the  decks . Pool on board: If a swim in the ocean becomes a bit daunting for those on board, guests can take a dip in this on-deck plunge pool . Spa: The mega yacht also features a gymnasium and mosaic-tiled hammam room (pictured), where guests can sit back and unwind after a day at sea . No expense spared: The privately-owned yacht was designed for the owner's specific tastes, and includes a round bath in the boat's marble master suite . Made for entertaining: Guests on board the vessel, created by Studio Zuccon International Project, can be sure of a place to sit at several indoor and outdoor living areas . The centrepiece of the yacht is the central stairwell with a crystal lift. A white Yamaha piano sits in the living area. ‘CRN is experimenting,’ Luca Boldrini, CRN’s sales director told Boat International. ‘We’re experimenting in design, in sizes, and in features. Each of the yachts in build has special features in development, and we hope the next step will be to mix and match all these new features in one or two new concepts so future owners can not only have a beautiful, seaworthy and safe vessel, but they can have special features that nobody else has. 'These will not be special features that are just an experiment, but features clients can touch and feel in other vessels under construction or already floating.’ 'At one with the sea': Oversized windows were purpose-built to take advantage of the sea views, and anyone lucky enough to stay in this cabin can also enjoy a balcony terrace, giving them an even better panorama across the ocean .

003a70daf9f99e871ba06482726176d7776d0c07,"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A German cruise liner said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Aden, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes. One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages. Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here. Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships ""to apply a robust and layered protective security regime"" when traveling through the area. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Passengers will fly to Dubai to continue their journey .

003be5a8108fcd3f133ddef14a5fc593701566f3,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's third-largest city Guangzhou -- capital of China's richest and most progressive province Guangdong -- has announced it has taken the first concrete steps in unbolting the country's often reviled ""Re-education Through Labor"" (RTL) system. A senior judge told the state-run China Daily that all detainees in the city under the ""laojiao"" or RTL system would be released by the end of the year. ""The police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system, which has become outdated,"" Yu Mingyong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, was quoted as saying. ""Many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after ... their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years."" Guangzhou still has about 100 people in labor camps, he said. Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but said there were few RTL camps and detainees in cities. It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province. Despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and Marxist indoctrination -- HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers. How it started . Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet ""gulags"" -- a place where ""counter-revolutionaries"" and ""class enemies"" could be detained without trial. Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was overhauled in the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping released prisoners accused of political and religious offenses. According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Re-education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,000 people were held in 350 re-education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008. The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,000 people. Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, ""subversives,"" such as Falun Gong practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial. In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Yuming Yong, said the city's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system. ""Judicial reform of RTL has been a priority this year,"" Yong told the Nanfang Daily. ""Guangzhou has stopped approval of re-education through labor (cases) further highlighting the protection of citizens' personal liberties."" An administrative tribunal official Xiao Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be ""digested out"" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments. In January this year, the central government in Beijing strongly hinted that it would begin scrapping the system although Guangzhou's announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken. Cosmetic changes . While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reform-oriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system. Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic re-branding of an otherwise repressive system. ""Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that's their identity,"" Bequelin said. ""Unfortunately, this 'reform' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Re-education Through Labor' to 'Coercive Detoxification Center.'"" He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the RTL detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to HRW â€” are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in Beijing. ""It's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 RTL detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system. Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, 'Custody and Education,' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,"" Bequelin said. These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions. ""In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal. And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,"" he added. He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Beijing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage. ""As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end re-education through labor, not to shift detainees to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and offenders below the age of 18,"" Bequelin said. Backlash over exposed cases . Two high-profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash, forcing the government to address the thorny issue of RTL. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for ""disrupting social order"" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11-year-old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for re-tweeting Weibo posts that were deemed seditious. While even Guangdong's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was ""not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs,"" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL. ""The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,"" read one Xinhua editorial. ""It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.""

Jeremy's life was saved when his pet cat Tara selflessly pounced on the dog as it launched its attack, chasing the vicious animal down the street so her best friend could receive emergency medical help. Scroll down for video . Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when Scrappy the dog escaped and ran towards him. The Labrador-Chow mix has since been destroyed at nearby at Bakersfield animal shelter . To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment . Scrappy was destroyed after he continued to display aggressive traits during a 10-day assessment period at Bakersfield animal centre, according to TMZ. He bit two staff during his stay, and tried to attack any employee who brought him food and water. Last Wednesday, surveillance footage emerged showing Tara the cat saving Jeremy by pouncing on the dog as it attacked him. Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She . followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years . ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said.

She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They . named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond . Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means . driftwood. 'We named her . driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it.

003cefcdcf96dbca76aa17d72ee612fa3b40651d,"The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion.","Stuart Gulliver's bonuses allegedly paid via Panama-registered company .

003d23a256ce34d73e05968a04727c0ed4a2a456,"By . David Williams . They were intended to be ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing some of their most notorious crimes. The interviews, recorded for a history project, were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned. But after a fierce legal battle, the secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a police station in Antrim yesterday. Former friends: Gerry Adams (left) is pictured in Long Kesh prison with Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Hughes said Jean McConville was killed on Adams' orders . Murdered: At least two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader (right) to the murder of Jean McConville (left), the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, executed and secretly buried in December 1972 . At least . two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the . murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, . executed and secretly buried in December 1972. The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing. Adams . has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the . IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland . suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the . streets, questioned, shot and buried. But . the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a . detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the . 65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement. Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville's death or the IRA policy of 'The Disappeared' Grieving: Jean McConville's family members carry flowers and a photo of their mother following her death . They . include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger . striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s . Belfast Brigade. Hughes, . who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There . was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed . . . that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said. ‘I . did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was . being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or . disappeared as they called them now. ‘The . special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, . you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I . had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular . squad.’ Search: Irish police excavate the beach in Louth, Ireland, where the body of Jean McConville was found in 2003 . Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth . Funeral: The family of McConville carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered . The . other damning account is that of Dolours Price, the first woman to . become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the . terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973. Price, . who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small . select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast . Brigade. The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the . Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal . investigations to weed out informers’. ‘The . hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared,’ Price said. ‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply . told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or . whatever. Past: A younger Adams (centre) attends the funeral of an IRA member who was killed while planting a bomb . Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday . 'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them . across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember . some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’ Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman. ‘I know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children. Damning: Dolours Price, the first woman to become a member of an IRA active service unit, was the other operative to give a damning account . ‘I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary to a place of safety. ‘It was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to disappear her, thank God. ‘You don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’ Like Hughes, Price provided her personal account of her time in the IRA to be part of the Boston College history project and in subsequent interviews. Researchers at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed over relating to the McConville case. The wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s.

Rush Limbaugh has apologised for calling a college student a 'slut' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers' contraception. The controversial radio host's comments, which included a suggestion that Sandra Fluke should make a sex tape, caused a row which saw him abandoned by advertisers and even drew in Barack Obama. But today he acknowledged that he 'chose the wrong words' while trying to 'illustrate the absurd with absurdity', and insisted: 'I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.' Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls . for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually . promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have . forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their . employees. But instead he dialed up the . rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke should film herself having sex and . then claiming that she 'had boyfriends lined up around the block'. However, after three companies pulled . their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to . express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday . afternoon, three days after his initial remarks. His apology read: 'For over 20 years, . I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five . days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of . the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.' He went on to argue that 'personal . sexual recreational activities' should not enter the public sphere, as . this undermines notions of 'personal responsibility and accountability'. Mr Limbaugh concluded: 'In my . monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what . is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that . should reach a Presidential level. 'My choice of words was not the best, . and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I . sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.' Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show . Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments' On his radio show yesterday, the . 61-year-old defended his comments  and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke . 'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my . day'. He said: 'She's . having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried . here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the . truth.' 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch' Rush Limbaugh . On Friday three . advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show . after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious . institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said . in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever . happens. Mattress retailers Sleep Train . and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all . bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on . the show. ‘We don't condone negative comments . directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you . for your concern and input.’ 'Recent . comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number . spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all . advertising on that program.' A QuickenLoans spokesman . said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable . feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush . Limbaugh.' Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will . 're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it . will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’. Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college . Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying . woman should get the pill for medical reasons. And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.' Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks' Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments . Mr Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'. 'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'. 'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways . is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when . it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her . views.' More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has . also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with . Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'. When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.' Mr Limbaugh . said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth . control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes . her a prostitute. She wants . to be paid to have sex. ‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’ Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh. 'My reaction was the reaction . a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these . types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.' Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. 'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

003eaac389a2450171f99f216b95f8741b58cbf0,"(CNN) -- Do you suffer from FOMO (otherwise known as ""fear of missing out"")? Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being -- WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE -- cause your heart to constrict with terror? Well, friends, we hear you. Having just returned from the liquor- (and other liquid-) soaked climes of Austin and SXSW, we're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3% of all ""Cool Things"" present at that havoc-wrecked fest. Basically, all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex, and, mysteriously, Train (thanks Monstro!) and that the most-flogged apps at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead. Enter: Sonar, Highlight and Banjo, a new wave of social apps designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you -- without requiring that you look up from your smartphone (my Precious...)! These apps were, by far, among the most buzzed-about at SXSW, with Highlight taking the coveted top spot (according to Mashable). Charts and graphs aside, it remains to be seen whether Highlight will be able to assume the many-storied role of ""The Next Twitter"" or ""The Next Foursquare,"" both of which gained traction at Nerd Spring Break. That's partly because it and these other apps run in the background on your phone, with always-on GPS that drain your battery. But it's mostly because the word ""creepy"" keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new cadre of mobile apps. Still, don't let that silly little adjective scare you off! Because if you don't download these apps, you'll be missing out! And you don't want that, do you? Do you?! We didn't think so. That's why we've provided a handy scale for you below, which should be instrumental in finding the level of ""Creepy"" you FOMO-sufferers are comfortable with. Kind of creepy: Sonar . So you're chilling at your apartment, staring -- moleperson-like -- into the glowing half light of your computer screen. All your Sims have finally drowned in the swimming pool, and you're getting tired of thumbs-downing dubstep tracks on Turntable.fm, so you fire up Sonar. Sonar is a pretty simple app for Android (in beta) and iOS that shows you two things: Who is chilling at hot spots near you, and who -- in general -- in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting. When you launch the app, you'll be asked to connect to your social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), which lets the app deduce who might be interesting to you. Click on the ""Places"" tab and you'll see a list of locations in your area. Clicking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot (generated via Foursquare check-ins, etc. -- one doesn't have to be using Sonar to show up in the app), and what level of connection you have to them -- how many Facebook friends, Twitter friends, etc. If you see someone you might want to stalk -- I mean, TALK to, you can tweet at them from within the app. You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalkage -- I mean, talkage -- as well. The app also features a ""People"" tab, listing which friends (pulled from your social networks) have currently checked in near you, as well as other people of interest. Use that to hook up with your pals next time they ""forget to tell you"" about karaoke. It's not your fault the only lyrics you know are ""Wub wub wub wubwubwubwub wub Pzzzzzzz."" Creepy: Highlight . You're just your average tech-savvy businessman, all pimped out in front-pleated khakis, your startup-emblazoned T-shirt of choice, and, of course, your ubiquitous SXSW Interactive Platinum Badge swingin' around your neck. Reclining there on your barstool, sweating Mojito in hand, you cruise the room with your eyes. With whom should you birth your future children -- uh, I mean your latest business venture? Suddenly, your cell vibrates in your holster. You whip it out with delight to see ... a shiny new notification from Highlight. Could it be? Is your dreamboat partner in this very room?! SXSW fave Highlight is what is known as an ""ambient location-sharing app,"" which means that it is always on (unless you ""pause"" it), alerting others using the service to your whereabouts. When you first install the app, you'll be asked to connect via Facebook, thus porting all your friends and interests into Highlight. From there on out, you'll be alerted via push notifications every time someone of interest is nearby -- you know, folks with a lot of mutual friends, hobbies, taste in TV, etc. These interactions will also be stored in a kind of in-app log. From there, you have the option to check out their profiles and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting. You can also ""Highlight"" people for future reference, which is kind of the equivalent of a ""wink"" on an online dating site (IE a complete wuss move). That's right, tech-savvy businessman, now you can meet all kinds of interesting people -- mere feet from your nervous self -- without the hassle of the initial awkward introduction. Highlight now, message one Mojito later. Meet IRL if they deign to answer you. Super creepy: Banjo . Your doll collection just isn't cutting it anymore. Seriously, how much can one stretch one's imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for inanimate objects? And QVC's wares aren't getting any cheaper. If only you could discover some brand new friends -- complete with dossiers (like the books that come with those American Girl dolls) -- with whom to maybe, possibly, someday but not likely hang out with. Well, you've got a friend in Banjo! Banjo serves two purposes: It alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity, and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you -- and around the world. Upon downloading the iOS/Android app, you can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Google+ to keep track of all your friends. When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you (you can change the distance from one-fourth mile to 10), you'll get an alert. If they're using Banjo, you can send them a message in-app, and if they're not, you can post a message to whatever content or check-in they shared, asking them to join the service. (We don't recommend doing this unless you're OK with someone putting cheesy words in your mouth like: ""How cool! Banjo tells me we're close by, so let's connect!) If the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling (""Jesus Christ, who the F cares that you went to the bodega and bought dish soap?!""), you can toggle over to the ""Explore"" map or the ""People"" box to check out a graphical representation of people in your area. That info is collected via check-ins/content as well, so users don't have to be Banjo members to show up on your map. From there, you can click through whatever content they're sharing -- tweets, Instagram photos, etc -- and live vicariously to your heart's content. You can even message folks if they're Banjo members (or spam them -- like your friends -- if they're not). Bonus: Banjo also shows who has looked at you, so there's plenty of opps for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other's profiles until one of them breaks. The app even lets you creep internationally, virtually zooming around cities like Paris and London and anywhere else your heart desires. And you thought that Canadian Maple Leaf doll from the Babies A Bloom collection you bought last week was an international adventure!","Sonar, Highlight and Banjo are a new wave of social apps that were all the buzz at SXSW .

'If a team are going to be playing for a 1-0 then you better see it out,' Neville said on Monday Night Football. 'When I saw Jose Mourinho two weeks ago he talked about the 2005 (Chelsea) team and (compared) the team he had then to the team he has now and he said the killer instinct's missing.

'When I look at the statistics they are staggering - 28 times they (the 2004/05 team) scored first (in Premier League matches), 27 the season after and they only dropped two and four points (respectively).

0040eb79bd5424f52e1ec43050539e4e12189cbf,"By . Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 13:47 EST, 4 January 2012 . As Burberry today unveils its new spring/summer campaign in store windows and across social media networking sites, millions of ardent fans will be watching. Just last month, it was announced that the British company had become the world's most successful  luxury fashion brand on Facebook and Twitter, with a record 10million fans on Facebook, and almost 700,000 following the brand's regular UK feed on Twitter. Meanwhile, they have thousands more global Twitter fans following their international feeds and post exclusive content on their own YouTube channel. Behind the scenes: Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne on set of the latest Burberry campaign . Burberry's social media success has grown exponentially - and it is still growing fast. The secret, say consumer experts, is the fact that Burberry share so much unique content exclusively with their followers on social networking platforms, and post new and different content to each one. What is posted on Facebook will be different from that on Twitter, and dialogues are constantly being carried out across both. Just this morning, Burberry placed . three new videos from their latest campaign, starring My Week With . Marilyn star Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne, onto their YouTube channel. And at the news that the brand had . reached 10million Facebook fans, Burberry Chief Creative Officer Christopher . Bailey uploaded a personal thank you via a video message to the site. Days later, a further 163,000 had joined. At ease: The two chat between shots . All this direct contact gives fans that bit more involvement with the brand - and keeps them connected. 'Christopher is really involved,' Burberry told MailOnline. 'He has answered fans' questions personally on . Facebook, and he's very active on Twitter.' 'It gives people something new. It's a direct and personal route for them.' Their groundbreaking, inclusive . approach goes against the practiced elitism of luxury brands, and ultimately brings . fans closer rather than keeping them at a distance. While other fashion houses operate . strict closed-door policies that isolate all but the inner circle - Tom . Ford famously showed his last collection to a tiny selection of invited . contacts, with no photographers and only a handful of select Press allowed - Burberry have . embraced this public approach. Indeed, Burberry was the world's first . fashion house to 'Tweettalk', posting images from its autumn/winter fashion show on to . Twitter - . before the models had even stepped out onto the catwalk. The innovative move meant fans . were able to see the collection before the celebrity front row and the . fashion Press had even caught a glimpse. For his part, current star of the . campaign Eddie Redmayne reports that Christopher Bailey is, as one would . expect from his democratic approach to business, a 'gem of a man' 'I am a huge fan of Christopher Bailey,' he says. 'He is a brilliant designer and a brilliant man. 'The fashion world can be a tad intimidating but Christopher remains a kind, grounded gem of a man. And judging by the latest figures, there are at least 10 million people out there who agree. Intense: Cara, 18, has been the face of Burberry since January last year, when she appeared in the brand's S/S11 campaign . Check it out: The spring/summer Burberry campaign starring My Week With Marilyn's Eddie Redmayne and Brit socialite and model Cara Delevingne . The pair model the Spring Summer 2012 collection for the Burbery Prorsum collection . Social media success story: Burberry has over 10m Facebook fans - and counting . About the videos, Bailey says: 'We wanted to capture a moment in the lives of two exciting and inspiring British actors who have been part of the Burberry family for several years. 'The images reflect the mood of the collection through Eddie's and Cara's energy, playfulness and effortless elegance and I have such huge admiration for them both.'

0043419182bdb005875dd3da575ebe38570907e8,"The Sunni extremists running roughshod across Iraq could produce 'a thousand' global terrorists like Osama bin Laden bent on widespread death and destruction, Iraq's ambassador to the United States warned on Monday. Lukman Faily said that if the United States and other nations focus too much on Iraq's internal politics and ignore the 'immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophic. 'This is a global tumor in Iraq taking place now and in Syria,' he said, referring to the Sunni militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 'We've seen it before.' The White House has scolded Nouri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for provoking ISIS by alienating the country's Sunni minority. Barack Obama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Maliki's Shia majority. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 'a thousand' Osama bin Ladens could emerge from among the Sunni extremists pushing to take over Baghdad . Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq's US ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery . 'Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,' Obama said in public remarks. 'So this should be a wake-up call.  Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all ""nice to have"" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?' 'We're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. 'We want to have that discussion. But we're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question.' 'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.' 'No POWs,' he warned. 'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.' 'That's the situation in Iraq.' Obama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. An administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of ISIS. Obama is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq. Amanpour pushed back against Faily, arguing that the more 'immediate threat' to Iraq was political inequality enforced by Shiites against Sunnis . ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries . 'A thousand of them': Faily says the late Osama bin Laden (pictured), who masterminded al-Qaeda's 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning is ISIS is allowed to press forward . Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged Iran at a time when that Islamic republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. Faily said Monday that whether or not the White House decides on a path of limited cooperation with Tehran, Iraq needs help urgently. 'We have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. ... The administration now understands that urgency.' he said. They have been willing to say, ""We are willing to help."" What we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow. A decision has to be made. It should have been made yesterday. 'From our perspective,' Faily said, 'the urgency of the ground are giving us less options and more radical options.'","Lukan Faily said Monday that while Obama frets about Iraq's internal politics, ISIS is gathering strength .

Speaking ahead of a counter-terror summit in London today, he warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'. As foreign ministers from across the globe fly into London to discuss strategy to take on the jihadis and prevent Paris-style atrocities. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured with US Secretary of State John Kerry today, warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack' David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street, where he vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem'. Speaking in No 10, Mr Cameron said: 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Iraq is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom ... We will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the mayhem we see today.' Later Mr Abadi will join representatives from 21 countries, including US secretary of state John Kerry and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters battling against ISIS - also known as Isil, as well as by its Arabic acronym Daesh. The Hammond is hosting the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS at Lancaster House in London . Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by events in Iraq and Syria. 'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast. 'There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria. 'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent. 'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.' David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street ahead of the security summit in London . Mr Cameron vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem' But he warned that Iraq's security forces will not be ready for months to take on ISIS fighters who have seized large swathes of the country. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Iraq's security forces in the years following the ousting of Saddam Hussein, they had fallen back into a 'state of disarray'. 'There is a big challenge ahead of us,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'We are renewing and regenerating the Iraqi security forces - re-equipping them, retraining them, reorganising them - but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Isil.' Air strikes by Britain and its allies had 'very effectively' contained ISIS while action was taken to 'rebuild' the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: 'They will be able to do it, the question is when they will be ready to start that process.'","Hammond warns against complacency in the fight to disrupt terror plots .

00459587adf060c93966ce7f1e2e33fae1d87f7c,"Parents who encourage their young children to take part in cage fighting contests could be jailed for child cruelty, legal experts warn. They face sentences of up to six months for allowing a boy or girl of primary school age to take part in the sport – described as  ‘barbaric’ by the Culture Secretary. And a Preston social club which hosted the boys’ fight reported in the Mail yesterday is to be investigated over whether it broke its licence conditions. The revelations come after a video emerged showing Kian MacKinson, nine, and a boy of eight, whose father has requested he remain anonymous, kicking, shoving and grappling in front of baying adults. The footage caused outrage among child and medical experts, who called for a police and social services investigation. Brutal: Child cage fighting can continue despite the boys being filmed without padding or head gear . Upsetting: The young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight, and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a Preston working club . Battle: Kian MacKinson, nine, with an eight-year-old whose father has asked for his face to be obscured . Parental support: Kian with his father Nick Hartley, the youngster features in the shocking video which shows hundreds of baying adults goading the primary-age boys to fight each other . A source at the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘A young child being forced to take part in any violent sport could constitute child cruelty. As such, a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12-week sentence or a maximum 26-week sentence.’ Social services bosses in Lancashire  confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the cage fighting, which is also known as mixed martial arts, to ‘consider any child safety concerns’. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘barbaric’. ‘Getting more young people doing sport is great but I do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage,’ he said. ‘It feels very barbaric and I know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that.’ He added he was ‘shocked and surprised’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments. His comments came after the British Medical Association, the NSPCC and . Safechild branded child cage fighting ‘disturbing and sick’. A British . Association of Martial Arts spokesman insisted: ‘Children this young . shouldn’t be involved in cage fighting.’ Lancashire Police officers have decided to take no further action either on a child safety level or licensing of the premises. It emerged last night, however, that council chiefs have ordered a . licence review for the Greenlands Labour Club and will ask the venue not . to put on any similar events involving juveniles. The deputy leader of Preston City Council, John Swindells, said: ‘I am . appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking . place in Preston. ‘Having checked the club’s licence there is a condition that children . should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and I think it . needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached. Professional appearance: Just like in an adult event, the tiny fighters have an entourage. Seconds out: The boys are brought together in the middle of the cage fighting ring, prepared to do battle . Grappling: The pair begin their fight slowly, testing out the space between them as they start their bout . ‘As such, I have now made a request for the licence at Greenlands Labour Club to be reviewed. A formal licensing review process will now follow.’ That could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter. A similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say. The shocking video that emerged on Wednesday shows Kian and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear. One of them is shown apparently receiving medical attention for a leg injury and bursting into tears. Fight: Before long, they have hit the canvas and take turns in pinning each other down . Young fighters: The children wear no padding or headguards for the ten minute bout in Preston . The event was held almost a fortnight ago with about 250 adults paying £25 a ticket to watch 14 fights. The other clashes involved semi-professional adults. Sources said the night was a boisterous alcohol-fuelled affair. Sharefight, the company commissioned to film the event, said the video had been removed from the internet ‘out of respect’ for parents and others who had shown concern. The event took place in a ‘safe environment’, a spokesman added. Greenlands Labour Club has also defended its decision to hold the event. Time out: Scantily clad ring girls parade on the canvas in between rounds .

Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6. The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. Indication: The two women accused of drug smuggling might enter guilty pleas to secure transfers to UK jails . But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story. They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing. Now, Peruvian counter narcotics prosecutor Luis Mendoza has said the women could apply to serve their sentences in Britain. He said: 'It's very possible that they may complete their sentence in the United Kingdom.' Miss Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.' But a legal source close to the case told the Mail a transfer could take many years, by which time they could be free. Write caption here . The women are expected to serve . two-and-a-half years of a six-year-and-eight-month sentence, after which . time they can apply to serve their parole in Britain anyway.

'It . is a very long process and Britain does not often agree to it. It is . not in their interest to. Why would they want them in their prisons?' A . 2008 Peruvian law gives foreigners the option to serve sentences back . home, and Britain has a prisoner transfer agreement with Lima. Miss Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly, from Northern Ireland, will need to show they behaved well in jail, pass 'legal, social, medical and psychological tests' and can fund their own tickets back. They are currently being held in the tough Virgen de Fatima prison, on the outskirts of Lima. Charities warn of dire conditions and claim poorer inmates are forced to prostitute themselves in return for food. However, Miss Reid has compared it to a 'Brownie camp', and said she spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions. Hope: William Reid, father of Melissa, believes he can start the ball rolling to get his daughter moved to Glasgow.

'I thought ""wow, that is pretty unusual to . see"", so I grabbed the binoculars,' he said. 'At the time they were heading south along . the coast about 100 metres off the headland. It was pretty special.' He added that a bird watcher had said he . spotted the whales near Trevose the following day. Fisherman Zyg Gregorek, who has travelled the world hunting . fearsome sea predators, said: 'All sea predators present a danger.

'If a . swimmer or a surfer got too close to a killer whale, it only takes one swish of . the tail and you've had it. 'A killer whale might be curious around . humans and therefore might attack, whether by accident or design. Also, because of over-fishing, their diets have been affected.

In a case she says brings to light plagiarism in the burgeoning world of online self-publishing, Rachel Ann Nunes of Orem filed a federal lawsuit in August against a Layton teacher, Tiffanie Rushton, who she says cut and pasted large sections from an electronic copy of her book. Nunes wrote 'Love to the Highest Bidder' in 1998 about two art dealers, one from New York and the other from California, who meet while competing for an Indian Buddha statue and fall in love. A Utah author claims a schoolteacher plagiarized her Christian romance novel, added graphic sex scenes and passed it off as her own . It was first published by a Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-oriented publisher. After the book went out of print, Nunes got the copyright and put out a slightly revised e-book version on Amazon.com with the name 'A Bid for Love.' Rushton's manuscript, 'The Auction Deal,' is about an art dealer who goes to Beverly Hills to bid on a rare sculpture and meets a successful gallery owner from Chicago, according to an online description. The full e-book has been pulled from the site goodreads.com. Nunes claims the book, which was not published in print, was written by Rushton under the pen name Sam Taylor Mullens. 'All the characters are the same, lines throughout and the plot. It is really hard for me to read it,' Nunes said Tuesday. In a case she says brings to light plagiarism in the burgeoning world of online self-publishing, Rachel Ann Nunes of Orem filed a federal lawsuit in August against a Layton teacher, Tiffanie Rushton . 'I feel like my life has been stolen.' She named a character after one of her seven children, making the added sex scenes particularly disturbing. Rushton did not return phone and email messages seeking comment, and no attorney has yet been listed for her. Though the story had been altered, Nunes says the details were recognizable to bloggers who Rushton asked to review an advance copy of the manuscript. Nunes' book, for example, contained this line in chapter one: 'For six years, he had put up with her overt stares and innuendos because she was not only his boss and sole owner of the gallery but also his friend.' Rushton's first chapter included a similar line, according to a screen shot posted online by Nunes: 'For ten years, I'd tolerated her overt stares and innuendos because she was part owner of our gallery and always seemed to find opportunities with new clients that helped the gallery that I could not.' Rushton appeared to be recasting the niche Christian story Nunes wrote into a book that would appeal to a mainstream romance reader looking for a more erotic tale, she said. 'It really is the thing that sells the most,' said Nunes, who has written 47 books in the last 18 years. In email exchanges between Rushton and Nunes, Rushton said the idea came from a friend who died in a car wreck and that she didn't want to reveal her real name because she is Mormon and her extended family wouldn't approve of her writing, according to the suit. Nunes said she's confirmed Mullens and Rushton are the same woman, though she declined to provide details, citing the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Davis School District confirmed that Rushton has been a third-grade teacher since 1993. After their exchange, Nunes says negative reviews began popping up on Amazon.com, Facebook and other websites. She alleges that Rushton created seven different profiles in an attempt to discredit her. Nunes is seeking at least $150,000 in damages as well as attorney's fees in the suit, which was first reported by the Ogden Standard-Examiner. Since filing it, Nunes says she's heard from other authors whose work has also been copied from their e-books. The books are often pulled when the plagiarism is identified but later reposted under a different name. 'It's so much easier ... online, you can be so anonymous,' she said. 'How many authors can afford to take someone to court? That's your life savings, that's your whole future.'

It brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘heavy police presence’. This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle . to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on . the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London . Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some . officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of . shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in . organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on . Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark  Cavendish at the Help . the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police . Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but . comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for . purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes . officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month . ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could . face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards . set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail . regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style . assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male . officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese . and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review . some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot . complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment . should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just . because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very . fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1.    Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.    A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull).   You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine.

The Shiite cleric has been in Iran since early 2007, apart from a public appearance in Iraq in May 2007. He has been studying in the Iranian city of Qom to become an ayatollah, the title given to high-ranking Shiite Muslim religious scholars. Al-Sadr commanded one of Iraq's most formidable private armies after the fall of Saddam Hussein, which contributed to violence and instability in the country for several years. His political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The Sadr movement emerged as one of the kingmakers in Iraqi politics in March, when it won 39 parliamentary seats. The bloc's support played a major role in al-Maliki getting his second term in office.","Muqtada al-Sadr has been in Iran since 2007 .

In a videotaped interview published Tuesday, he told Bloomberg Television that 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second cold war,' in part because President Barack Obama 'could be more tactful politically.' Seated at his private residence outside Moscow and speaking through an English translator, Medvedev blasted Obama for leveling sanctions at the Russian government and its wealthiest oligarchs. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev blasted the Obama administration -- with a smile! -- for bringing the world to the brink of 'a second Cold War that nobody needs' Nerves fraying: Russia claims it has withdrawn troops from near the Ukrainian border, but tank commanders at checkpoints are still standing guard . Naive? Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pressed a red prop 'reset button' along with then- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, but the two countries' relations are now at a post-Cold War low . 'Let's be . honest: Those sanctions are a sharp knife for European business,' he claimed. 'And . American business doesn't need them either. The only ones who want . sanctions are politicians, who use them to reinforce their convictions . and demonstrate their power.' And in a mafia-like jab, the Russian legislative leader hinted that if he wanted to, he could push back against U.S. sanctions. 'You've probably noticed that we have not commented on them a great deal or responded to them harshly,' he told Bloomberg reporter Ryan Chilcote, 'although we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions.' Asked about the now-infamous 'reset button' effort that he co-engineered with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, Medvedev said the Obama administration has unraveled any Russian good will that may have existed five years ago. 'Yes, I believe that President Obama could be more tactful politically when discussing those issues,' he said. 'Some decisions taken by the U.S. administration are disappointing.' Pressure: Russian President Vladimir Putin joined with Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) to oversee joint naval exercises on Tuesday as the two powers seek to build ties in the face of Western criticism and territorial disputes . Medvedev hinted at repercussions for U.S. economic sanctions, saying that 'we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions' 'We have indeed done a lot for Russian-U.S. relations. I believe doing so was right. The agreements that we reached with America were useful. And I'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved is now being eliminated by those [U.S.] decisions.' 'Basically,' he claimed, 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second Cold War that nobody needs. Why am I saying this? Because a competent politician knows how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and intelligent decisions –  which, I believe, Mr Obama succeeded at for a while.' 'But what is being done now, unfortunately, proves that the US Administration has run out of these resources. And the United States is one of the parties to suffer from this.' Medvedev's interview came as the U.S. was still seeking 'firm evidence' to support Russia's claim that it has withdrawn soldiers from the borders of Ukraine. Ukraine is gearing up for an election to replace former president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of street protests.

004e6e935ea530b0992a89fd1307f7f41f4a234d,"(CNN) -- If kings and queens are able to savor the best things in life, why shouldn't they get to retire, too? It's not traditional, and it kind of goes against one of the biggest perks of being a king or queen -- a secure job for life. But it happens, as the world saw Monday. King Juan Carlos I of Spain became the latest royal to say he's stepping down. It's ""time to hand over to a new generation,"" the 76-year-old announced in a televised address, declaring that he's leaving the job he's had for nearly four decades. His son, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, will take over. The Spanish King is one of several monarchs to step down in recent years. Queen B takes her leave . In January 2013, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands passed the crown to her son Prince Willem-Alexander. He was 46 at the time. Queen Beatrix had been ruling for more than three decades. Much beloved by the Dutch people, she tried to assure them that her retirement didn't mean she was taking off for Florida and forsaking their love. ""This doesn't mean that I'm taking leave from you,"" she told a throng of admirers in Dam Square outside the palace in Amsterdam. Her abdication was a move marked by tradition in the Netherlands -- knowing that it's best to go out while on top, historians say. Queen Beatrix was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. ""Beatrix's abdication wasn't controversial,"" explained royal commentator and historian Richard Fitzwilliams. ""The people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy."" A father to son handoff in Belgium . In July 2013, King Albert II of Belgium gave up his kingship, reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties. Those duties include ""suggesting, advising, warning and encouraging"" lawmakers in the country, according to Belgium's government website. King Albert was 79 when he retired. He had ruled for 20 years. His son, a 53-year-old trained fighter pilot who became King Philippe, took over. The country had been in turmoil at the time, torn between the North and South where residents spoke different languages. A pope quits (and makes history) Europe must have been especially lovely in 2013, because even the Pope didn't want to keep working. An unprecedented ""I quit"" came in February when the Vatican announced that Pope Benedict XVI -- Germany's Joseph Ratzinger -- was leaving the papacy. His ""advanced age"" was the reason he wanted out, the Vatican said. The then-85-year-old had led the Catholic church since 2005. He became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post. So what do monarchs -- and one pope -- do when they retire? Benedict's retirement hasn't been all that different from anyone else's. Archbishop Georg Ganswein told Reuters that Benedict has been doing a lot of reading, reflecting and praying. He's taking walks in the Vatican gardens, playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery. He's mostly a homebody, making only a few public appearances, such as the canonization ceremonies for Popes John XXIII and John Paul II in April. A change of the guard in Qatar . Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013. Sheikh Hamad, who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father, sent out a public message to announce his plans. ""I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,"" according to the Independent. Sheikh Hamad's decision to cede power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. His son, Sheikh Tamim, became the youngest monarch in the region at the age of 33. Spanish selfies and change . In Spain on Monday after the King announced his departure, tourists took selfies in front of the royal palace in Madrid. Some gazed through the gates. ""Change is good, new blood could be good, why not?"" said Spaniard Natividad Andres. ""Everything is so unpredictable, you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work."" Lola Garcia told Reuters that she worried about what the abdication indicated. ""It's a shame. I'm really sorry,"" she said. ""I don't know what's going to become of Spain and I don't like what I see coming."" On Monday, the King noted in his speech that Spain had been suffering financially. ""The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,"" he said. Royal watcher Fitzwilliams called King Juan Carlos' abdication a ""real tragedy."" ""He wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparate Spain,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""Spaniards -- many of them older -- are great admirers of him."" There was still a ""tremendous amount of good will"" toward the King, he said, despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule. King Juan Carlos' popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip in Botswana, and Spanish news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot. The image appalled many Spaniards. Fitzwilliams recalled Monday, however, that the King had, in his long rule, managed to bring together fractious political groups in Spain and stop a right-wing military coup in 1981. ""He's done the country enormous service,"" Fitzwilliams said. Could a British royal be next? The news of King Juan Carlos' abdication didn't shock British author and historian Kate Williams. ""We've seen this in Belgium and the Netherlands,"" she said. ""I think it's often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vibrant and fun. But you will never see it in the United Kingdom. Never."" Queen Elizabeth II has said that she believes the job of ruling Britain was given to her by God, and only God can take it away, Williams said. The queen staying in her job is critical to a cohesive sense of culture in Britain, she said. But it's happened before in the U.K. There's no way Queen Elizabeth doesn't consider the shock waves sent through British society when King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936. That ""haunts"" the palace still, Fitzwilliams said. King Edward caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, an act that broke the rules of the Church of England. He gave up the throne and became the Duke of Windsor. Together, the couple toured Germany. It was reported that the former king had Nazi sympathies. He lived out the rest of his life in France. The episode is considered, Fitzwilliams said, a shame on the legacy of the British monarchy.","Netherlands, Belgium and Qatar all had monarchs step down in 2013 .

00504275ede73591d94a6c1f994fd4856610421c,"Even death couldn't part two skeletons excavated from a lost chapel in an English county, found with their fingers entwined. A team of archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) are working with volunteers on a four-year excavation project at the site, which overlooks the small village of Hallaton. Vicki Score, ULAS project manager, says the skeletons were placed together in this position, as there was enough room in the grave to have them buried apart. Aside from the bonded couple, 11 skeletons have been found so far, which are yet to be analyzed, but some discoveries have been made already. Score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe. Another, she says, was in his mid-twenties, with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life. ""He was buried in a very unusual position in a pit with his legs splayed widely apart, arms flexed at the elbows and hands tucked beneath his chin. ""We have no idea why he was buried like this -- it could possibly be due to a medical condition."" Both skeletons also had lesions on their skulls which suggest they had head lice. The team are hoping to find out more about how the gravesite was chosen. Score says: ""We have seen similar skeletons before from Leicester where a couple has been buried together in a single grave. The main question we find ourselves asking is why were they buried up there?"" It is thought the chapel may have served as a pilgrimage, or the main church possibly refused to bury the bodies because they were criminals, foreigners or diseased. She adds that Roman archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there, which made it a special place. Other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site, fragments of stone masonry, wall plaster, tiles and lead from the windows. Silver pennies dating between the 12th and 16th centuries give clues as to when the chapel was in use. In 2000, the Hallaton Treasure was discovered, consisting of Iron Age coins, parts of Roman helmets and debris from feasting. The county was also where the remains of 15th-century monarch Richard III were uncovered beneath a parking lot in 2012, raising questions about how the controversial ruler lived and died.","Two skeletons were found holding hands, buried at a lost chapel in Leicester .

00512126d65bf2a36801e4ef37f28c86c29deb28,"(CNN)The New York Police Department faced a newly pressing question in recent weeks: What constitutes an online ""threat""? Police reviewed hundreds of online postings--and made several arrests--over alleged anti-cop threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month. It used to be a lot easier to define threats.  It's not that our dialogue has evolved much.  It hasn't.  Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it's in rap lyrics or Guns N' Roses songs.   Kids have consumed violent art and speech since long before Hansel and Gretel baked a witch in an oven, or Beowulf hacked his way through Southern Scandinavia. The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media. Suppose, after the recent NYPD threats, I posted that I planned to ""swarm on any m... in a blue uniform,"" meaning specifically the ""punk police."" Suppose I promise that ""when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of cops dyin.'"" Scary right?  If I tweeted that today, I might expect police at my door.  In 1988, though, there was no Twitter ... or e-mail ... or ""online,"" come to think of it, when the rap group NWA came out with its (famous) ""F*** Tha Police,"" containing those very lyrics.  People then were offended, of course.  But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today. There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercially mass-produced cassette tape. And when a megastar like Axl Rose sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much, and bury her in his backyard,  millions heard those lyrics.  That's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers reading some guy's rabid musings on Twitter. So, threatening speech online is not about how viral or far-reaching it is. Our society is not as interested in protecting social media rants as it is in protecting artists because—whether the courts say it or not—we really don't feel as good about protecting dummies.  We will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists, even if we find their work repulsive. Instinctively, however, we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of, say, a bitter child custody dispute and access to a Wi-Fi signal.  It seems that if some shmendrik wants to rant on the Internet, he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like ""lyrics."" That analysis dovetails nicely with the issues before the Supreme Court in a case called Elonis v. United States.  In Elonis, an ""aspiring rapper"" used violent language on Facebook to rant about his wife, an elementary school and an FBI agent. Under the First Amendment, the court must decide whether a ""threat"" requires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, or if it is enough to show that a ""reasonable person"" would regard the statement as threatening.  If the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent, that test would be a higher burden, and more favorable to defendants.  But even under the ""reasonable person"" standard favored by prosecutors, the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat. Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it's not because it can reach many persons: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific person—but be overheard by many others.  Maybe that's the key. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with Mel Gibson). Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authored by the speaker alone.  In that sense they feel more like the unfiltered statements of present intent. As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it's time to draw the line at social media.  Then again, I'm biased in a way that perhaps the justices are not.  I'm on social media, and the tweets directed at me from time to time are, let's say, pretty threatening and too profane to reprint here. Maybe the justices would be less inclined to equate the lyrics of Eminem (as Justice John Roberts recently did)  with the poetic musings of frighteningly abusive tweeters if they had more personal experience with social media. The NYPD confronts a similar problem.  How is it to know the difference between a true threat, the work of an artist, or some troll sounding off online? The Supreme Court may contain the brightest minds of our time, but compared with your average 14-year-old, they are Luddites.  I've never seen a hashtag in a Supreme Court opinion, and I seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on Instagram.  Tasked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate—or threaten—online? Even if they do, by then the kids will be onto the next thing anyway .","Danny Cevallos: Arrests over tweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is threat .

A year ago talkSPORT, managed to dupe some Blues supporters into believing that their club was linked with various players during the January transfer window - only for those names to be made up.And 12 months on, the radio station has been at it again outside Stamford Bridge - with the theme being of Star Wars characters this time around dubbed as 'Transfer Wars'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Chelsea fans fooled in Star Wars transfer target prank . Chelsea fans were duped into believing that players based on Star Wars characters were transfer targets . TalkSPORT dubbed the video 'Transfer Wars' in relation to the sci-fi franchise theme . Keen to prove their unrelenting passion for the club though, fans claim to have seen 'trio' JJ Binks (Jar Jar Binks), Artur Detur (R2-D2) and Stew Bacca (Chewbacca) - with all three reported welcome additions to Jose Mourinho's squad. Binks, a centre back or a left winger from the MLS, is described by one fan as the 'new John Terry,' while another says he will be a good signing on the flanks. Bacca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older 'brother' Carlos - the Sevilla and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old 'sibling' though, Bacca's main 'attributes' are his ability to play as a target man. The 6ft 5in forward would be a welcome addition according to the Blues faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba. 'Stew Bacca' was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba . 'Artur Detur' like JJ Binks is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left winger . Detur, like Binks, has the rare tactical flexibility to play in the heart of defence and or on the left flank - a trait that Chelsea supporters clearly feel would be a bonus commodity. The France star's potential arrival is one relished by the west London faithful, although one fan believes he needs another season before he can make a real impact at the club. Although the force is not with all Chelsea supporters, two were switched on to the prank. Upon hearing of Binks a male duo state that they have 'never heard of him,' before querying that the MLS prospect 'sounds like something out of Star Wars.' The duo's suspicions are confirmed upon hearing Detur's name but alas if only their fellow supporters were as clued up. The prank didn't fool these two Chelsea fans (centre and right) though who were wise to the made-up names .

A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a 'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticised Katie Tantum, 33, for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Tantum was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm 'just stopped bothering' with her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Tantum is suing law firm Travers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant . Miss Tantum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is suing for loss of earnings. Helen Croke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Tantum’s progress that the Cambridge graduate 'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents. She said: 'I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. 'It was a not a good review. Clearly corporate wasn’t a good seat for her.' When comparing Miss Tantum's review with that of another trainee, Ms Croke said it was like 'comparing apples and oranges.' She said Miss Tantum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. She added: 'Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares. 'Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect. 'I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katie’s work on transactions were poor. 'When you’re in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee. 'I can’t believe she didn’t know she was making mistakes.' Miss Tantum's lawyer accused Ms Croke of launching a 'full frontal attack' on Miss Tantum in her witness statement after she said the plaintiff 'gave the impression she didn’t want to do what she was doing'. The tribunal also heard that Ms Croke was 'very critical' of Miss Tantum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.30am because she did not feel well. David Massarella, representing Miss Tantum, said: 'You made a comment on her leaving work in the middle of the night. 'She knows she left at 6.30am. She knows that because she went to Pret, which does not open until then.' Ms Croke denies criticising Miss Tantum's behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. In her witness statement she said: 'I told my supervisor, Mahesh Varia, who seemed supportive and thanked me for telling him. Miss Tantum said she was criticised for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night . 'But Mr Mahesh just stopped bothering with me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating.' Miss Tantum, who is fluent in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her. She said: 'I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.' The firm's head of real estate told the hearing he was 'delighted' to find out Miss Tantum was pregnant. Julian Bass said: 'Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasn’t surprised because of her age and so on. 'I was genuinely delighted.' But despite a glowing review from Mr Bass, Miss Tantum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees. He said: 'She was a strong contender in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skills which could make her a good real estate lawyer.' The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by 'mute' partners when discussing Miss Tantum’s future at the firm. Ms Croke said: 'I don’t believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Travers Smith.' The hearing continues.","Katie Tantum claims she was criticised for leaving early after working through the night at law firm Travers Smith .

Privacy and civil liberties campaigner: Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis . The extent to which mobile phones act as ‘spies in our pockets’ has been exposed  by a senior Tory MP. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis discovered how closely we can be watched when he asked his phone provider for the information it held on him – and found it could track his every move. Mr Davis investigated after American whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the security services were forcing phone companies to hand over  data on their customers. The campaigning MP, who writes about his discoveries in today’s Mail on Sunday, says the list of times and  co-ordinates – known as metadata – showed ‘where  I had been at any one time for a year’. It was so detailed that Mr Davis was able to plot out his movements over a day. The one he chose was during last year’s party conference in Manchester, and the data mapped his meetings with members of the public, journalists and parliamentary colleagues. ‘I could see exactly where  I had been at pretty much every point of the day,’ writes Mr Davis. ‘So in conjunction with those people’s phone records, the data would show everybody I met that day.’ Mr Davis has been an opponent of efforts by Home Secretary Theresa May to introduce a ‘snooper’s charter’ extending the State’s power  to monitor communications. Sinister: Mr Davis found that metadata collected by phone firms tracked his exact location and movements . He added: ‘The State rarely asks for information which isn’t of use to it. With this metadata they can learn as much about me as they can by reading my emails or eavesdropping on my calls. ‘Since the Snowden revelations, we know that  our security services have engaged in legally dubious monitoring of our metadata. ‘We know that they, along with many Ministers, want the legal power to do this on an even bigger scale. ‘This has serious implications for our privacy.’","David Davis investigated the true nature of mobile phone 'metadata'

No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil. That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with  sadness. Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch videos of Neymar after his World Cup ending injury . Emotional: David Luiz hugs Neymar as he waits to board an ambulance after Friday's win over Colombia . Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back . Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday . Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win . ‘Forca Neymar,’ she tweeted, as did others such as model Gisele Bundchen, Miami Heat basketball star LeBron James and German footballers including Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, who must have been secretly delighted to learn Brazil’s best player cannot face them in Tuesday’s semi-final. Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win. Neymar will not play again in this tournament. The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original  No 10 who also hailed from the  Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom. Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air. Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury . Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star . Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses. ‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition. 'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. ‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’ Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery . Devastated: Neymar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home . Thanks: Neymar managed a wave as he left for Sao Paulo . Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. ‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’ Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final. Support: Brazilian model Gisele Budnchen said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot . Team spirit: Leo Messi also took to social media to wish his Barcelona teammate a speedy recovery . Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think. 'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to  injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’ Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan. ‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’ The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad . Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders. In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone . Silva was magnificent in the  quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack. The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt. ‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. 'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar. This could unite us. It could give us more determination to win.’","Neymar out of the tournament after injury late in the quarter-final .

When it comes to wrinkle-busting skincare and a . holistic approach to looking and feeling younger, Dr Nicholas Perricone . is the go-to guy for a host of Park Avenue princesses and Hollywood's leading . ladies. He first hit the headlines in the early nineties with . his books The Wrinkle Cure and The Perricone Prescription, which . claimed that a diet rich in salmon and berries could help you look . younger in just three days. And now, the man himself has teamed up with Ocado to bring his service to your front door. Coming to a door near you: Ocado have teamed up with Dr Perricone to offer his three-day diet to shoppers . Ocado are introducing a Perricone food basket on their website, which means with just a few clicks all the ingredients can be added to your list and delivered together in your chosen time slot. This anti-inflammatory . diet, which is rich in lean proteins, antioxidants and essential fatty . acids, is said to be followed by celebrities such as Eva Mendes, Cate . Blanchett, Kim Cattrall and Julia Roberts. Dr Perricone believes that wrinkles, . lines, puffiness and sagging are a symptom of ‘inflammation’ at cellular . level, caused by poor diet, overexposure to sun, air pollution, and . other modern-day skin irritants. His . plan counteracts premature ageing by directly reducing cell level . inflammation through a special diet high in omega oils and other . nutritional wonder-foods, as opposed to Botox and surgery. Foods in his diet include salmon, tuna, turkey, olive oil, nuts, fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs. One of the key ingredients in the . food basket, which starts from £80, is salmon, which contains essential . fatty acids that help to dramatically reduce puffiness, increase . radiance and add firmness to the skin. Dr Perricone is so convinced by the power of salmon, he recommends you eat it twice a day, but you may substitute it for poultry or tofu if necessary. Youth is one click away: Ocado is introducing a Perricone food basket, which means with just a few clicks all the ingredients can be added to your basket and delivered together in your chosen time slot . Famous fans: Youthful Eva Mendes and Cate Blanchett are said to be big fans of Dr Perricone's diet . But does it work? Lorna Driver-Davies, NutriCentre Nutritional Therapist, said: 'My initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon Dr Perricone suggests is consumed to achieve results. 'NHS advice says males and women past child-bearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of child-bearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week. 'This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend someone eat this much salmon for any kind of diet. 'If they wanted to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is certified as being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants. 'The rest of the diet is actually really good - particularly almonds, berries and plant oils such as olive oil - think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.'

Abortion-rights groups, which say more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas have since stopped, then asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling.

The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. Davis, who is running for governor, blasted Tuesday's decision.

0059bb8b2718a83dfffa071bfbc6b49c2bc0ed13,"(CNN) -- ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" hopes to be the next big, addictive role-playing video game, and its creators are putting an emphasis on ""big"" with a wide-ranging environment and a deep story line. But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Big Huge Games studio general manager Sean Dunn was working in Los Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on ""Reckoning."" After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. ""This is a passionate and competitive group who want to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),"" Dunn said. ""This team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studios. These people believe in what they are doing."" Dunn said the new ""Reckoning"" game contains more than 10 novels' worth of back story from best-selling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,000 to 50,000 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Todd McFarlane and the gaming vision of Ken Rolston. But his team of 110 people was tasked with bringing all that creative energy to life. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamics and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Big Huge Games team could make a game as big as it envisioned. ""It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, in where it was 'We are making a huge game, and it's going to be great,' "" Quadara told CNN. ""Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything."" The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic role-playing game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gaming while still presenting a cohesive story. ""There's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,"" he said. ""The engine itself is a full-on action game, fighting game engine, but it's also a full-on RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other."" If trying to design hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,000 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Tim Coman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. ""You stop worrying about pedaling and just keep moving,"" Coman said. ""You just take each individual step as it's coming and focus on 'We're going to get this done, going to get this done.' "" ""There's a depth there that you know walking in, you're going to be building lots and lots of stuff,"" he added. ""Ken Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he's fantastic. He and I would have conversations daily. How do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?"" Coman's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear visually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to gamers' sense of exploration. ""R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we've repeated around here: 'If you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.' For us, we wanted to put all that in there so that the players that really are RPG fanatics can see this is a real-deal RPG. And [for] the people that are action-game players, it is a real-deal action game."" Both Coman and Quadara admit they don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of ""Reckoning."" ""Take the blue pill,"" Coman said while laughing. ""Don't even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels' worth of writing, just in the game itself,"" Quadara added. ""The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head."" However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. It is rated M for Mature because of blood and gore, intense violence and suggestive themes.","New ""Reckoning"" game has more than 10 novels in back story from writer R.A. Salvatore .

An insurance boss accused of hiring attractive teenage girls to ogle and grope has been cleared of seven sexual offences. Stephen Perry denied sexually assaulting two 17-year-olds when they worked for him at his Rotherham business throughout a trial at Sheffield Crown Court. The 58-year-old widow was today found not guilty of seven sexual offences against the two women but admitted some of his behaviour 'could have been taken in the wrong way'. rothe . Speaking after the case, Mr Perry said he felt 'vindicated' by the outcome of the trial. 'I feel I have been vindicated. These allegations were unfounded and I told the police as much. 'I am a friendly man and one of them described me as a fatherly figure which is about right. I encouraged a friendly, relaxed atmosphere at work and they misconstrued things.' The insurance chief added he would not hire teenagers to work at his firm in the future. 'I have made the decision like Lionel Blair once said that I'm not going to work with children any more. 'I now employ two 45-year-old women in the office who work for me.' During the trial it was alleged Mr Perry told recruitment managers to hire 'cracking' young women and that he liked employees 'young and fresh'. Sean Kilbride, who supplied candidates to the business, told jurors Mr Perry had instructed him: ''If they’re cracking, they’ll get the job, you know what I mean,' before adding he liked employees 'young and fresh'. 'He told me he was looking for 16 and 17-year-olds, preferably a girl,' Mr Kilbride said. One of the women alleged he grabbed her from behind while she was bent over in front of a filing cabinet, while the other claimed she felt 'uncomfortably' with the 'touchy, feely' boss. 'He was eyeing me up and down. I felt uncomfortable. I was trying to shrug it off, it was disgusting. He had his tongue out and was staring at me . 'He said: ""Don’t ever come to work in a skirt and glasses because I will not be held responsible for my actions if we are left alone.""' Mr Perry denied the allegations, insisting he had a 'fatherly' relationship with the two women and that there was no sexual motive behind his behaviour towards them. Jurors at Sheffield Crown Court (above) took just 40 minutes to clear the 58-year-old widow of all charges . Accused of putting his hands over one of the girl's faces so that she would not see what was on his computer screen, he said: 'I don’t know where that’s come from.' Both were 17 when they worked for Mr Perry in 2012 and 2013. They were sent to the company where they earned £100-a-week as apprentice clerks, but quit after a few months. During their interviews the women claimed Mr Perry quizzed them on whether or not they had boyfriends and 'oohed' at one woman's bottom in the office. On one occasion one of the women claimed he grabbed her from behind and 'rubbed' his crotch against her. This was strong denied by Mr Perry throughout. Jurors took 40 minutes to clear him of all seven charges brought. Speaking after the trial, the widow said: 'In hindsight I probably did say things that could have been taken the wrong way,' adding he 'may have comforted' one of the women in 'a fatherly manner' by patting her bottom. The only other contact was when he put his hands on one of their shoulders while she was working at a computer to poke fun at her height, he said. Mr Perry admitted to observing one of the women had 'big' breasts but did not touch them, and says he may have 'touched' her thigh instead of slapping it as accused. She was hired, he insisted, on the basis of her CV but that he once had to tell her off for coming to work in what he thought was an inappropriate blouse. At the time of the alleged assaults, Mr Perry's wife was dying of cancer, it was heard.","Stephen Perry has been found not guilty of seven sexual offences .

Resuming at 7-7 against world No 24 Philipp Kohlschreiber he needed to draw on all his Grand Slam experience to eke out a 3-6 6-3 6-3 4-6 12-10 victory that took two days to complete and 247 minutes on the court.

Soldiers swooped on a home just after midnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli forces have concentrated their search for the killers. The arrest came after protests over the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager spread yesterday from Jerusalem to Arab towns in northern Israel. Scroll down for video . An Israeli military vehicle patrols the West bank city of Hebron this morning, around the same time that soldiers arrested a Palestinian man in connection with the murders of three Jewish teenagers killed near the city . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. The Israeli Defence Force would not elaborate on the arrest . An American teenager - the cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy - who was beaten and detained by police during the protests in east Jerusalem was today brought before an Israeli court. Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted what the Israelis claimed were rocket launchers and a weapons workshop in the Gaza Strip, after 29 rockets and mortars were fired into Israeli territory. Relations between Israel and Palestine have been tense since Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel were abducted on June 12, leading to a massive Israeli military operation in Palestinian areas. They were later found dead in a shallow grave, a discovery quickly followed by the the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was snatched from his home in East Jerusalem. His burned body was found in a forest. Palestinian officials said a post-mortem indicated the 16-year old had been burned alive. Israeli police say they are still investigating the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, but Palestinians say Israeli extremists murdered him to avenge the deaths of the three Israelis. The three Israeli seminary students (from L-R) Naftali Fraenkel, 16, who also holds U.S. citizenship, Gil-Ad Shaer, 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19, whose killings have sparked the current round of violence . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. His arrest came as violence spread from Jerusalem to Arab communities across northern Israel, with with hundreds of people throwing rocks and fire bombs at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said police had arrested 22 Israeli Arabs. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights, but still face discrimination from the 'Jewish State'. Even so, violent riots like those that occurred yesterday are rare. Clashes had mostly subsided by early this morning, but the situation remained tense. U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, left, 15, was beaten by police when he was arrested on Thursday after a protest over the murder of his cousin, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, right, became a violent clash with Israeli police . Police today asked a Jerusalem court to extend the detention of 15-year-old U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, who was badly beaten by police during the clashes. He is the cousin of murdered Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir. His parents say their son, who goes to school in Florida, was the last person with Mohammed shortly before he was snatched. They said Tariq left Mohammed to eat before the Ramadan fast began at dawn Wednesday, and Mohammed was seized shortly afterward. The feared Israeli border police charge at Israeli Arab protesters during clashes in Ar'Ara, northern Israel . Police said Tariq Abu Khdeir resisted arrest, attacked officers, and was captured with a slingshot for lobbing stones. Abu Khdeir's face was masked in a keffiyeh, an Arab headscarf that some Palestinian protesters wore during the clashes to conceal their identity, police added. He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day. Amateur video of what Tariq's father Salah said was the beating aired on a local television station, and he said he could recognize his son from his clothing. Pictures of the boy taken after his arrest showed his face badly swollen. The U.S. State Department said it was 'profoundly troubled' by reports of his beating and demanded an investigation. Israel's Justice Ministry quickly launched a formal investigation.","Palestinian held after police swoop on his home in West Bank City of Hebron .

005d650be8cfb6db3eee51d92188ac64509eb59c,"The Ospreys opened their Champions Cup campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a bonus point 42-7 victory over outclassed Liberty Stadium visitors Treviso. Wales fly-half Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys' best attacking moments as full-back Dan Evans touched down twice, while wing Jeff Hassler, scrum-half Rhys Webb and number eight Dan Baker also scored tries. Treviso wing Ludovico Nitoglia scored a late consolation try, converted by former Worcester and Wasps fly-half Joe Carlisle, but there was little for the Italians to cheer on another dismal European occasion for them. Dan Evans scores his second, and Osprey's fifth, try of the match in what was a routine win over Treviso . It meant the unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Pool Five, teeing up nicely next Saturday's clash against reigning Aviva Premiership champions Northampton at Franklin's Gardens. Saints will start as favourites - they beat Ospreys twice in last season's Heineken Cup - but Biggar and company can head to the East Midlands confident of making an impression. The only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was Wales autumn squad hopeful Baker being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. There was a 10-minute stoppage while Baker received attention from medics. Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys' best attacking moments . Treviso, back in Swansea little more than a month after they suffered a 44-13 PRO12 defeat against the Ospreys, were soon under pressure when Biggar sparked a brilliant counter-attack from deep inside home territory. And although Treviso halted that move, two successful Biggar penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest-ranked team in this season's competition. There was a fluency about Ospreys' play and after Biggar completed his penalty hat-trick inside 13 minutes, their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong set-piece play, slick handling and a neat Biggar pass than sent Hassler over. Biggar added the conversion, and Ospreys were well on their way to a potential bonus-point victory, leading 16-0 early in the second quarter of a one-sided encounter. Dan Baker was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury . Treviso's cause was not helped by the loss through injury of captain Antonio Pavanello, and they were then temporarily reduced to 14 players when Pavanello's replacement Marco Fuser was sin-binned by French referee Pascal Gauzere for pulling down a maul deep inside his team's 22. Ospreys then kept up the pressure, and Webb sniped his way over for a sixth try in seven starts this term - form that suggests he will strongly challenge Mike Phillips to wear the Wales number nine shirt against opening autumn Test series opponents Australia on November 8 - and Biggar's conversion made it 23-0. The Ospreys forwards looked to maintain their grip in the second period, and their dominance led to a further Treviso indiscretion that saw substitute prop Salesi Manu yellow-carded, which as with Fuser's caution cost the visitors dear. Justin Tipuric of Ospreys is tackled by Treviso's Italian No 8 Alessandro Zanni . Within a minute of Manu's exit, the Ospreys struck for their third try when Evans grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies, and Biggar's conversion left Treviso 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining. The bonus-point try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as Treviso's defence found itself scattered to all parts, enabling Baker to enjoy an unopposed run-in before Biggar maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts. Baker's injury did not noticeably disrupt the Ospreys' rhythm, and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superbly-timed scoring pass by the impressive Webb to an unmarked Evans. Treviso showed plenty of commitment and desire, despite the scoreline, but their technical, tactical and skill limitations mean it will be a major surprise if they win a European game this season, especially as their other pool opponents are Northampton and Racing Metro. With the game long done as a contest, Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy had all eight of his substitutes on well before the end, including Wales internationals Justin Tipuric, Aaron Jarvis and Duncan Jones, but he knows the European campaign is about to crank up considerably as Northampton lie in wait.","Ospreys beat Treviso 42-7 in their Champions Cup opener .

005fd0fe0dda2d0e94cc8279b91cef2c0fb4a704,"By . Claire Ellicott . A young patient who died of dehydration at a leading teaching hospital phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty, an inquest heard yesterday. Officers arrived at Kane Gorny's bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away. The keen footballer and runner, 22, died of dehydration a few hours later. Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication . A coroner had such grave concerns about the case that she referred it to police. Yesterday an inquest was told how Mr . Gorny died after blunders and neglect by 'lazy and careless' medical . staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London. His mother Rita Cronin, a civil . servant told Westminster Coroner's Court that staff tutted at her and . repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn't been . given vital medication. At one point he became so desperate . and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night . before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical . staff, despite being in a room on his own. Following his death, a nurse allegedly . inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, was . 'finished' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could 'bag . him up'. Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and . was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, had survived a . malignant brain tumour in 2008. Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane's father Peter Gorny arriving at their son's inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright . The cancer affected his pituitary . gland, which controls the body's mechanisms, such as fluid levels. Part . of his treatment included a course of steroids to regulate the fluid . levels in his body. These drugs, however, weakened his bones and he was . in hospital for a routine hip replacement. Doctors told him that, without regular medication to control his fluid levels, he would die. When he arrived at hospital for the . hip operation, nurses assured the family they would give him his . medication and said: 'Don't worry, he's in good hands – we'll look after . him.' But, despite the repeated reminders . and insistence by both Mr Gorny and his family, staff failed to give him . the tablets and he became severely dehydrated after being refused . water. In an interview with the Daily Mail in . 2010, Miss Cronin said of the nurses who treated him: 'They were lazy, . careless and hadn't bothered to check his charts and see his medication . was essential. He was totally dependent on the nurses to help him and . they totally betrayed him.' Yesterday Miss Cronin told the inquest . she received a distressed phone call from her son on May 27, 2009, in . which he told her he'd called the police because he was so desperate for . a drink. Help: Police raced to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London (pictured) but were turned away by staff . She then went to the hospital where . she found him 'confused and angry', shouting at staff and behaving in an . uncharacteristically abusive manner. Despite this, one doctor asked if he . was 'coming off the booze' and another asked if he was 'always like . this'. Miss Cronin said: 'He sounded really, really distressed. He said . ""They won't give me anything to drink"". 'He also said ""I've called the . police. You better get here quickly: they're all standing around the bed . getting their stories straight"".' When Miss Cronin arrived, she . recalled: 'They weren't doing anything. They seemed out of their depth. It felt like the two locum doctors were nervous about calling anyone . more senior than them.' The inquest heard Mr Gorny was . restrained by security guards and sedated with strong medication to calm . him down. Later, he was put into a side room and left alone. Miss Cronin said she sat in his room . for three hours the night before he died without a single nurse checking . on him or giving him vital medicine. 'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip.' Kane's mother Rita Cronin . She said she told a nurse who walked . past the room that Mr Gorny had not had his medication.  When Miss . Cronin volunteered to return to the hospital should he wake, another . nurse allegedly told her: 'You don't need to do that. If he makes noise, . I'll close the door and then he won't wake everyone up.' She added: 'I later realised that her comment was unbelievable but I was so distraught that it didn't register.' The morning of her son's death, May . 28, 2009, Miss Cronin arrived at the hospital early to find him . delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue. She recalled: 'I then heard three . nurses outside his room and I said: ""There's something wrong with my . son. He doesn't look right."" 'The nurse said to me ""He had a good night. There's nothing wrong with him and he's just had breakfast and a chat with us."" 'I thought: ""How could he have had breakfast? There's no evidence (of breakfast)."" 'The nurse carried on her handover then I interrupted again and said: “He's not right.” 'The other nurse then tutted and said: . ""She's already told you he had a good night."" And with that the three . of them walked off.' Miss Cronin said she then noticed that . her son hadn't been given his medication because the packet was still . on the table by his bed. She told the locum doctor about her concerns, but the doctor said it wouldn't do him any harm. A doctor doing the rounds then checked . on Mr Gorny. Miss Cronin said: 'He took one look at him then he started . calling to everyone “Get in there quickly”. 'It suddenly dawned on me he hasn't . had his medication, hasn't had his bloods done, nobody's given him a . drink, nobody's bothered to put his drip back on him. 'Nobody's done anything since yesterday afternoon when he became aggressive.' She said there was a 'flurry of . activity' and everyone 'had a very sad look on their face' as they . battled to save her son's life. Miss Cronin said: 'The main doctor came . out and you could tell he was really angry. He said: “You need to go and . see your son. He's dying.” The couple then found their son lying . in blood and fluid-soaked sheets and a nurse came in and asked them to . help her to change them. The same nurse later came into the matron's . office and asked whether they were 'finished', adding: 'Can I bag him . up?' The death certificate said Mr Gorny died of a 'water deficit' and 'hypernatraemia' – a medical term for dehydration. Mr Gorny had radiotherapy and . chemotherapy following his diagnosis of brain cancer. He was eventually . given the all-clear and led a normal life until his mother noticed he . was having trouble with his hip. As he waited for the surgery, his life started to return to normal. 'He was out and about like everybody else,' said Miss Cronin yesterday. 'I always used to make him take his . tablets for the next morning, just in case he stayed at a friend's house . – and he knew the importance of his medication. We all did. 'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip. He was upset he was having a . hip replacement - he was worried he would be in a wheelchair when he . was 50.' Nurses at the hospital were said to have been offered counselling as a result of Mr Gorny's death. The inquest continues. The case is still being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.","Nurses forgot to give Kane Gorny his medication and he became so delirious he called 999 .

A grinning and giddy Elliott joined Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Hoda Kotb this morning as one of the four anchors on Today. The move comes just one month after his six month non-compete clause with ABC expired. Scroll down for video . Moving up: Josh Elliott (left) joined Hota Kotb, Matt Lauer and Al Roker (seen above with Tamron Hall and actor Jim Carrey) as one of the four anchors on Today this morning . Old gig: Elliott (above with Ginger Zee, Lara Spencer and Amy Robach) left his post at Good Morning America in March . Elliott was filling in for Natalie Morales, and assumed her news-reading duties throughout the morning. This is a big move up for Elliott, and something that will likely anger execs over at ABC. At the time of his departure from the rival network, it was said he would be working with NBC Sports, and would appear on Today only to do sports-related segments. This morning however, Elliott looked very comfortable filling in, bringing in some of the banter and humor that he used to help GMA topple Today in the ratings race starting back in April of 2012, after the show's 16 year run as the most watched morning news program. Thrilled: Elliott shared his excitement about hosting the morning news program on Twitter today . The show has continued to struggle in the ratings since then, pulling in just 4.7 million viewers the week of October 13 as opposed to Good Morning America's 5.4 million, this according to TV Newser. And while America has kept things simple with just four anchors, Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer, George Stephanopoulos, and Amy Robach, along with meteorologist Ginger Zee, on camera during the two hour program, Today now has nine anchors spread out over four hours of television, including Carson Daly, Willie Geist, Kathie Lee Gifford, Tamron Hall and Savanna Guthrie, in addition to Lauer, Roker, Morales and Kotb. Old pals: Elliot (right) and pal Sam Champion (middle) left GMA within months of one another, with Elliott being replaced by Robach (left) Personal life: Elliot (left) is engaged to NYC news anchor Liz Cho (second from right, seen with Jonathan Tisch and Champion) There is no word yet if Elliott will now be a permanent fixture on the show, or will just be stopping by in the absence of Morales. Elliott, who is engaged to New York City's ABC news anchor Liz Cho, wanted to get out of his gig at Good Morning America so badly that he reportedly took a pay cut to head over to NBC back on March 30. TMZ reported that Elliott felt slighted over the $14 million contract Roberts signed to stay on as anchor of the program, as he was only offered an annual salary somewhere between $4 and $5 million. Permanent gig: It is uncertain in Elliott will now be a regular fixture on Today, or just fill in when Natalie Morales is absent, as she was this morning . He ended up signing a contract for just over $3 million a year to go to NBC, with no promise he would ever be on Today. The move came just a few months after his good friend Sam Champion also left the program to take a job with The Weather Channel. Elliott was replaced by Robach while Champion was replaced by Zee.","Josh Elliott made his first appearance as a co-anchor on Today this morning, filling in for Natalie Morales .

Friends, family and even competitors braved a cold Michigan day for a pair of afternoon visitations for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. Some piled off of school buses and hugged each other in the crisp winter air.

0061dddffc23dab36031475efdc679ab13be3a50,"(CNN) -- Jury selection kicked off Thursday in the federal corruption case of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his associates, who are accused of setting up a criminal enterprise in the mayor's office that engaged in racketeering, bribery, fraud and extortion. A panel of 12 jurors, with six alternates, will decide the fate of Kilpatrick; his father, Bernard Kilpatrick; contractor Bobby Ferguson; and Victor Mercado, a former director of Detroit's Water and Sewerage Department. Prosecutors say they were involved in rigging millions of dollars worth of city contracts and extorting city contractors. The jury panel will be whittled from a pool of more than 200 potential candidates. All four men have maintained their innocence. Their attorneys were not immediately available for comment. Ex-Detroit mayor got free trips from pension fund broker, feds say . Prosecutors say the defendants were ""working together to abuse Kilpatrick's public offices, both his position as a state representative as well as his position of mayor of Detroit, to unjustly enrich themselves through a pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud."" At the heart of the scheme was corruption in municipal contracting, mostly centering on the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, said Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Derrick Miller, a former Kilpatrick aide, entered into a plea agreement last year and is expected to testify against his former associates. In September 2008, the ex-mayor pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. 2008: Detroit mayor apologizes to supporters, says he will not resign . 2010: Former Detroit mayor indicted on 19 fraud, tax charges .","The jury panel will be whittled down from a pool of more than 200 candidates .

0061e7c11acc1f8f4c4f423db11f38df39b748b7,"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- Few people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. We were with the Frankfurt Zoological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where Bobo the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall of the crate and Bobo slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. That also happened to be the direction where our tech expert John had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. It was an incredible sight and a great shot. Read more: 'We knew this was going to be a trip like no other' I was actually a bit nervous seeing Bobo look at us. FZS Indonesia Director Peter Pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable. We had no idea what to expect. Did we make him feel threatened? Would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Borneo are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It's illegal to have one as a pet because it's an endangered species, but they're sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It's a brutal process. Mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It's a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That's exactly what happened to Bobo. He was five years old when his owner gave him up. Bobo was then brought to Peter Pratje and his team at the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Read more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest . When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan like Bobo, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity. So the FZS team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior. It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would've taught her baby. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After Bobo left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn't. Frustratingly, Bobo wasn't using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Read more: Orangutans stressed by eco-tourists . After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day for until they're sure the orangutan can survive on its own. Several members of the team were following Bobo that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit. Nothing worked. Minutes ticked by. Finally, Peter theorized that Bobo was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. Bobo has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. We didn't want to hurt Bobo's chances of survival, so we decided to leave him and the FZS trackers to go about their day. It was too early to tell how Bobo will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. We would have to wait and get an update from Peter later. Walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide. If this species can be brought back from the brink of extinction, could this be a model for other species?","Jenni Watts produced Expedition: Sumatra, CNN's new environment special .

0064cb4483aea62ced1d8ed67c8129497bb303cb,"(CNN) -- Most of us have a favorite toy from childhood that still has the power to make us smile, whether it's a Barbie doll, a Micro Machine or the board game Operation. What makes them memorable is the subject of a new book, ""Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos,"" a collection of some of the most beloved toys of the 20th century. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as ""a catalyst for the imagination,"" Byrne said. Most of our favorite toys came into our lives when we were developing our identity and figuring out the world, he said. Some, like the rampaging dinosaur King Zor (1962), have faded from the cultural landscape, while others, like View-Master and Nok Hockey (which both hit the mass market in the 1940s), have been passed down through generations. The toys that stick with us are those that allowed us to explore new worlds and create experiences. ""Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination,"" said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. ""What makes each Barbie doll unique is how a little girl creates and projects her sense of self and her fantasies onto that piece of plastic."" Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal. ""Some, just by looking at them, reflect the design sensibility of the time, becoming almost works of art,"" he said. ""We identify with them in the cultural context of their time."" So, how can you tell if a toy will be a hit for your child? When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you're shopping for, Byrne said. ""The hot toys are only hot if they're hot for your child,"" he said.

In a damning indictment of community policing, one in four people has never seen a bobby walking the beat. Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence. Even the ‘Blunkett bobbies’ designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently. Damning indictment of community policing: The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency . High visibility: The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs . The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,000 by the Home Office. The British Crime Survey discovered that 55 per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month. But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when they were asked if they see officers on a daily basis. And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat. PCSOs, introduced by David Blunkett when he was Home Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time pounding the streets. The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency. One . of the most common demands from members of the public is for more . officers on the beat to provide reassurance that they are being . protected from thugs and burglars. But . Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said recently that fewer . than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man . the front line at any one time. Police . spending almost doubled, from £7.72billion in 1998/1999 to . £14.55billion a decade later. The number of officers increased from . 124,756 in March 1998, to a peak of around 141,000. Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Home Secretary . But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Police budgets are being cut as part of the Government’s austerity measures – with forces threatening to axe around 16,000 police officers. Last night Roy Rudham, chairman of the UK Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: ‘It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street and with the cuts being implemented the likelihood is they will see even fewer officers. ‘That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit.’ The Home Office survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing anti-social behaviour. And just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing louts to justice. The situation on police visibility has . improved. In 2006, four out of ten people said they had never witnessed . a police officer or PCSO on the streets. But it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and PCSOs. The . survey also found that only 4 per cent had used the online crime maps . introduced by the Home Office to give people a greater idea of crime . levels on their street and to increase police accountability. When the maps were launched at the start of this year, the website crashed – apparently due to high demand. In its report, Her Majesty’s . Inspectorate of Constabulary found that there are more officers on duty . on a Monday morning than at any other time of the week – and the fewest . just after midnight on Friday when drunken violence soars. Antiquated shift patterns, court . hearings and training requirements mean that in two forces – . Bedfordshire and Devon and Cornwall – only 9 per cent of officers can . actually tackle crime, it said. The . watchdog found many other forces fared little better, with an average . of 12 per cent of officers available to catch crooks and keep people . safe. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Denis O’Connor also highlighted how one in three members of the police workforce is not employed in a front-line role. These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration. HMIC is predicting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support  officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts. But it says there is so much waste that £1billion – the equivalent of a 12 per cent cut in government funding – could be axed without any reduction in police availability. This would be achieved by getting police out from behind their desks. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver. Police Minister Nick Herbert said: ‘We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns. And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims. ‘That’s why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.’","Findings uncovered in Home Office survey of 50,000 .

006684f2e2fa98b707502c549ab1a0ea0d22a3db,"Gordon Brown gave Labour rising star Chuka Umunna ‘the hairdryer treatment’ in a blistering phone call after the shadow business secretary publicly blamed him for Labour’s struggles on the economy. Mr Brown attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former Labour leader’s failure to confront Britain’s ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election. Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to even talk about Government ‘cuts’ was still costing Labour support, because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit. Labour are currently 25 points behind the Tories on which party is best for the economy. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (left) and Gordon Brown (right) clashed on the phone over Labour's record on the economy . But the remarks sparked a furious response from Mr Brown, MailOnline has learnt. The former Prime Minister told Mr Umunna that he should not accept Tory claims that Labour was spending too much before the last general election, a senior Labour source revealed. The source said: ‘He still cannot accept Labour was running a structural deficit. Even after all this time he won’t accept that he was wrong – it’s unbelievable.’ The deficit – the difference between Government spending and how much it raises in taxes each year – was more than £160 billion in 2010. Labour blamed the huge borrowing splurge on the global recession – because the Government was forced to withstand a huge hit on tax revenue as people lost their jobs, while at the same time increasing spending on benefits. But analysis has since revealed that the ‘structural deficit’ – the amount of borrowing needed even when the economy is growing normally – had grown to more than £100 billion in the last year of the Labour government. In an interview with GQ magazine, published this month, Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to face up to the deficit was still hurting the Labour Party. He said: ‘My view is that the seeds were sown under the last government and Gordon - for whom I have a lot of respect - his refusal to use the word “cuts” in trying to frame the economic debate as investment versus cuts gave the impression we didn't understand that debt and deficit would have to be dealt with.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) and the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right), who were both Treasury aides under Gordon Brown, have defended the party's record controlling Government spending . A source close to Mr Umunna confirmed the pair spoke in a telephone call after the interview was published earlier this month. The source said: ‘It is something they disagree on. ‘Chuka’s argument has always been that pursuing the line that it was Labour spending versus Tory cuts allowed Osborne to make the whole election debate about deficit reduction. They spoke and that is definitely still his view.’ A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: 'Chuka and Gordon are both members of the PLP - or course they speak to each other on a range of issues.

0066b77d259f645ce9226011d4aa13121a8ac57b,"By . Kieran Corcoran . A British TV producer was killed in Qatar when a speeding motorcyclist hit her while racing a friend at high speed. Kerry Rome, 33, moved to Qatar to work for TV news station Al-Jazeera, and had been out with colleagues before being knocked down as she crossed the road at 2am, an inquest heard. She was the TV station's first female technical director, and moved to the Middle East for work with her husband Mark Harris, 35. Killed: Kerry Rome, pictured, was knocked down and killed by a motorcyclist in Qatar in 2012 . Police initially believed Mrs Rome's death was accidental - but it later emerged that the motorbike rider had no driving licence, and was racing a friend when he hit Mrs Rome on April 20, 2012. A 21-year-old man was convicted of killing Kerry in a Qatari court in 2012 with a judge describing his speed as 'excessive'. An inquest in Stamford, Lincolnshire, heard that the biker hit Mrs Rome - who had just stepped out into the road - while trying to under-take his rival. Moments after stepping into the road she was struck by the motorcyclist as he attempted to under-take his friend. Giving evidence, Mrs Rome's mother Margaret, 62, described the moment she found out about her daughter’s death as 'the worst phone call of my life'. She added: 'My lovely daughter Kerry would be here today if that reckless, dangerous motorcyclist had not been racing with a friend at 2am'. Mr Harris also paid tribute to his late wife, whom he had married just months before her death in an Elvis-themed Las Vegas wedding. 'Excessive': The motorcyclist was undertaking his rival in a street race when he hit Mrs Rome. A Qatari court convicted him of the killing . Mark, originally from Market Deeping Lincolnshire, said: 'Kerry was an amazing person. She was kind, generous, there to help and never had a bad word to say about anyone. 'We were career-oriented adults who relocated abroad to make a good life and good careers for ourselves. 'This was all taken away by a man who was out racing a motorbike with his friends.' A toxicology report carried out in Qatar found 296mg of alcohol per 100ml in Kerry’s blood, around three-and-a-half times the British drink-drive limit. Three of Mrs Rome's colleagues told the hearing she did not appear drunk on the night she died. Oliver Walker said: 'We had a few drinks but nothing major as we were dancing close to the stage. It’s not like we were pounding shots at the bar'. South Lincolnshire coroner Professor Robert Forrest said: 'It had appeared that the motorcyclist was undertaking one of his companions when the collision took place.' Middle East: Mrs Rome moved to Qatar for work with her husband Mark Harris . He added that there was insufficient evidence to produce a verdict of unlawful killing, instead recording the incident as a death caused as a result of a road traffic collision. A friend of the family said today: 'The family are obviously disappointed that the coroner effectively delivered a verdict of accidental death. 'It is the family’s position that Kerry was not killed in an accident. The motorcyclist hit her during an illegal road race. 'If he had not been taking part in an illegal activity Kerry would still be here today.' Kerry and her husband Mark moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008 when she became the first female technical director of live news at Al Jazeera English. They then transferred to Doha in October 2011 when Kerry was promoted to Al Jazeera English’s head office. Speaking after the inquest, her mother said: 'She was such a vivacious person and so full of life. Considering how young she was she has done so much in her life. 'When we went out there and saw what life was like we realised how strong a person she was. We are all so incredibly proud of her and what she did.' Kirsty Rome, her sister, added: 'We were all really close, she loved her family. She did more in her 33 years than most do in a lifetime.'","Kerry Rome, 33, was killed around 2am on April 20, 2012 .

But the company hasn't said what new models, . if any, it will be launching, instead inviting journalists to a 'Special . Event', with the cryptic invitation 'Let's Talk iPhone'. The company remained typically tight-lipped about what the 'event' might launch - but it seems set to be epic. For . the first time, the event is being held at the company's Cupertino HQ in California - . at the famous address, 1, Infinite Loop, a geeky programming joke. Few . outsiders ever visit the complex - so even seeing the company on its . home turf is sure to ignite a media frenzy. Let's talk iPhone: The Apple invitation, with the date, the time and the location . Every previous event has been held at conference venues nearby. Apple . staff have been 'banned' from holidays in the first two weeks of . October in America, and tech insiders expect products from the launch to . appear in stores shortly after - probably on October 14. All the signs now point towards an early October launch for the gadgets. Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4. The event will be his first big product introduction . 'Having . seen first-hand how Apple packs its staff inside its stores for iPhone . launches does suggest that whatever new product they announce  is . imminent,' says Luke Peters, editor of T3. Tech insiders believe that any new iPad is far off in the distance, and that the current flurry of components, rumours and leaks refer inevitably to new models of iPhone. The idea that there are two models - one sporting the fast A5 processor inside iPad 2, and a cheaper model with lower-tech components, seems likely. Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month.' This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late in October. Mr Gore's statements - at a conference in South Africa - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent iPhone rumours. Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month' While the iPhone 5 is much anticipated, there is more at stake than usual.

He is also an adviser to the United States Army for diversity and cultural affairs. Al Vivian says Eric Holder was right to urge Americans to confront diversity issues now. FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African-American male and I am privileged. Not on race; but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed. As a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post-September 11 profiling. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others . Recently Attorney General Eric Holder made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in cross-racial dialogue. Holder's comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race. On confronting our history he said: . ""To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. ... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. "" Concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined: ""If we are to make progress in this area, we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us."" In a recent interview, President Obama responded by saying, America has made ""enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that ... I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language."" The president went on to say, ""I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here."" They were both right; but they were addressing two different things. Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions. Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions. Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation's human capital. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half-truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others. Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate a White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. This privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: ""When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing."" It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month. It's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters. What's missing is what the late Paul Harvey would have called ""the rest of the story."" George Washington Carver, a black man, had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut. His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context. The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut. George Washington Carver revitalized the agricultural south; thus the financial south. He saved the south. But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was a tremendous invention. However its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time, until a black man named Lewis Latimer contributed his invention, the carbon filament, to the project, making possible the widespread use of electric light. Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison. But most history books have no mention of Latimer. Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776. Great nation, strong republic, yes! Democracy, no. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people. To deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half-truths with reputably documented facts, our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history. We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot only talk. We must also listen. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism. As Holder said, this will be uncomfortable, but ""this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one America."" It's unusual when someone who is out of the norm makes his or her way into the seat of privilege, because those with whom you now share this privilege do not expect you to speak for those who do not. Welcome to your seat Mr. Holder, it fits you well. And thank you for not taking the coward's route. By the way, mission accomplished. We're talking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Al Vivian.","Al Vivian: Privilege creates blind spots that conceal the harm they do .

Alway was dismissed of more than a dozen other counts under a plea agreement. Some of those counts were resisting an officer, possession of a controlled substance, and receiving stolen property. The Desert Sun reports that Alway has been in custody since last year at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility on $150,000 bail. The ANTM finalist was arrested on June 28 in 2013 for investigation of burglary, fraud, narcotics possession, committing a felony while on bail and other charges, the Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement at the time of the arrest. Officers responding to a report of a suspicious woman walking around a neighborhood spotted a condominium with an open back door, police said. Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said. Authorities believed an armed man also was in the condo and the SWAT team was called in for the ensuing six-hour standoff.

00697ea6b46a074bd1d94417297b8f9c95db4d31,"(CNN) -- Lori Hyde was hunting for a unique vacation experience when her curiosity was piqued by Pretty Joe Rock, a tiny speck of land in the waters off Marathon in the Florida Keys with just enough room for a two-bedroom home and a few clusters of mangroves. She and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other's company, with no one else around but the resident birds. ""I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like, well it can't get much more private than that,"" said Hyde, 43, a stay-at-home mom who lives in Woodbridge, Virginia. ""It's not an exclusive sort of thing. We're just ordinary people who just did something cool."" Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific. If you have a lot of money to shell out, the possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don't have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique . Pretty Joe Rock, for example, can be yours for under $3,000 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Bob Rainek said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. ""It's almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,"" Rainek said. ""It's a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It's a primal type emotion, as I look at it."" Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country's drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Rainek said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called ""America's Caribbean,"" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands Inc., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as $550 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than $66,000 for a week on The Rania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a private chef, a yacht and other ultra-luxurious touches.) 'Robinson Crusoe' experience . For something in between, a budget of several thousand dollars a week is usually a good start. ""We're even finding more and more people who are saving and planning a honeymoon on an island. It's a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,"" Krolow said. ""It's probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married."" You can choose a self-catering island, which gives you the use of a home but requires you to bring your own food and make your own meals (the less expensive option), or a full-service island that comes with a staff, according to Vladi Private Islands, a company based in Hamburg, Germany. Its database of about 150 islands for rent includes everything from Île de Chantemesle near Paris, France, to Forsyth Island, New Zealand. Some people seek the thrill of being dropped off in a remote place that's completely undeveloped. On ""Robinson Crusoe"" islands, you are left to your own devices, make your own meals, bring a tent or hammock and anything else you may need, the company said. Nova Scotia, Canada, is one part of the world that offers such opportunities, added Sabine Rollinger, a Vladi spokeswoman. Krolow recalled a CEO who last year spent 10 days on a deserted spot in the Marshall Islands bonding with his 13-year-old son. ""It's pretty much the closest you'll get to being stranded on your own private island,"" Krolow said. Spending a lot or a little . On the other end of the spectrum, there's Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre paradise in the British Virgin Islands complete with luxurious accommodations and a large staff. It's all yours for at least $53,000 a night for up to 28 guests, though you can rent individual rooms for a fraction of that price during a select few ""Celebration Weeks."" YouTube: See what $53,000 a day gets you on Necker Island . It may sound like the ultimate getaway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all too yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed-and-breakfast on East Brother Light Station near San Francisco, California. Starting at about $300 a night, it's an island stay that's both private and not too hard on the wallet. Whatever your budget, an island may be waiting.","Many islands can be rented for a few thousand dollars a week .

A bird's eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris. The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others. On Friday three people remained hospitalized -- two in critical condition, one in serious condition. The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. A source said the workers were testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo, which is a spaceship being built for Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space tourism company. ""We were doing a test that we believed was completely safe. ... We don't know why it exploded,"" said Rutan, who was not at the site at the time of the accident.  Watch the aftermath of the explosion » . The explosion happened during a ""cold fire test,"" he said.

006a59c662a82db6c90b550b81abc7d7490311aa,"By . Associated Press . A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing for Bassel Saad, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of referee John Bieniewicz. The 44-year-old referee 'did not see the punch coming,' said Saleh, who played for Saad's team during the over-30 men's league game at Mies Park in Livonia on June 29. Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at a local hospital, had a wife and two sons. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Livonia, Michigan. Saad is charged with second-degree murder in the death of soccer referee John Bieniewicz . John Bieniewicz (pictured), who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area, died on July 1 . Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to eject Saad from the game. The punch, which Saleh said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to 'fall back without any control of his body.' Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonia, Michigan . In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to.

It ended with Judge Kathleen McCann denying prosecutors' motion to bring up an alleged 2005 incident in which Saad is said to have been involved in an altercation with another player at a soccer game. Defense lawyer Ali Hammoud said his client's past has nothing to do with this case, and prosecutors' interest in bringing it up shows that 'their case is extremely weak on second-degree murder.'","Bassel Saad, 36, charged with second-degree murder in Livonia, Michigan for the fatal punch on June 29 .

006dd02051a6d228fa3841ab555fced21fccdf1e,"Juan Andres Palese says he's a frustrated entrepreneur. His business, the sale of products for growing and processing marijuana, has always been in a legal limbo in Uruguay, his country. Legally speaking, it's a complicated and risky situation. Selling accessories for the cultivation of cannabis is legal, but the production, sale and distribution of marijuana are not. ""It would be fantastic,"" Palese says, ""if we could also have access to the market of consumers."" The dream of the Montevideo resident is about to come true. The Uruguayan Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small South American country the first in Latin America to legalize marijuana. The bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in July with 50 out of 96 votes. It also has the support of President Jose Mujica. The bill has generated international headlines because, if approved, the Uruguayan government would have the authority to regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. The legislation also has the support of the Broad Front, Mujica's party. Approval is widely expected. ""More than anything, it's going to give me peace about growing what I like, which is marijuana. That's what I like to consume. It would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal,"" Palese says. The bill rests on the premise that if ""the state assumes the control and regulation of the activities of importation and exportation, sowing, growing, harvesting, producing ... storing, commercializing and distributing,"" then the ills of drug trafficking would be greatly reduced and the quality of the plants improved, benefiting patients and putting drug traffickers out of business. The bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grams for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor's prescription.  Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies. But many in the traditionally Catholic country of 3.3 million people feel legislators are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons. Alfredo Solari, an opposition senator from the Colorado Party, says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction. ""It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market. There will be a legal market that can be accessed by most Uruguayans. But there will also be a parallel illegal market for all of those who can't get marijuana legally,"" Solari said. Proponents of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention, and advertising of cannabis in any form would be strictly forbidden. Luis Gallo, a senator with the Broad Front Party, which supports the bill, said current drug policy, which rests solely on law enforcement and prohibition, has produced no results. ""This is about regulating drugs. It's doesn't mean that it's a free-for-all, but it doesn't mean prohibition either. It means regulation has to work to reduce the risks and harmful effects of drug consumption,"" Gallo said. In an interview with CNN en Espanol, Mujica suggested in September that when it comes to drug trafficking, the trafficking part is usually more harmful than the drug itself, especially when it comes to marijuana. ""We would like to identify those who consume (marijuana), take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume (the drug) so that they don't have to depend on drug traffickers. We want to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them,"" Mujica said. Supporters of the bill launched a national campaign called ""Responsible Regulation."" The campaign produced public service announcements in which a doctor, a mother and an attorney suggest it makes sense for Uruguayans to support the law. Once the bill gains approval, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations to implement the law.","Bill to legalize pot widely expected to pass in Tuesday vote .

006f475a6f4c972d20c491433156a6c28cfacd99,"A man who was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of cancer two years ago is now amazingly in remission thanks to a revolutionary treatment that involved receiving an infusion of the virus that causes AIDS. Marshall Jensen of Utah, was one of 30 leukemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at Penn Medicine recently, in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of HIV programmed to target and kill cancer. The 30-year-old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer-free for the first time in years. Scroll down for video . Cancer free: Marshall Jensen's (right) leukemia is in remission after receiving a breakthrough cancer treatment that involved the HIV virus. Pictured above with wife Amanda (left) and their son Kezman (center) The 30-year-old Utah man was one of 30 patients in an experimental trial, who received doses of the deactivated HIV virus, which act as cancer killing fighters in the body. Of those who underwent of the treatment, 23 are still alive and 19 are now in remission . Jensen, wife Amanda and their young son Kezman have been travelling the country ever since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012, just one year after their marriage, searching for an effective treatment for his cancer. 'They were a young couple. They weren’t married very long. They had a brand new little baby when all of this started,' neighbor Lindsay Wright told KSL. The Jensens didn't find success though until they met Dr Carl June at Penn Medicine. Dr June and his team of physicians have spent two decades working on a breakthrough experimental treatment using the HIV virus. On Thursday, Jensen was welcomed back to his Utah neighborhood, after travelling the U.S. these past two years for treatment . Jensen (center) and his wife Amanda (left) are pictured above with Dr Carl June, who led the gene therapy trial at Penn Medicine . 'We were calling it our Hail Mary pass,' Marshall Jensen said. 'It felt right. … We didn't know how we were going to get out there, what we were going to do, but it worked. By God's grace I was able to come back.' On Thursday, a healthier Jensen returned to his neighborhood in Utah to a surprise homecoming celebration. The connection between leukemia and HIV was first discovered in 2006, when an HIV-positive man named Timothy Ray Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation, Brown's cancer went into remission and the HIV disappeared from his system making him the first man to ever be fully cured of the virus. Dr June is now looking to use the treatment to combat other types of cancer. Jensen (right) pictured above with his wife (left) and their son (center) Since then, Dr June and his team have been working vigilantly on developing a HIV-based treatment for leukemia and this October, published a study showing the therapy's success on 30 cancer patients. The patients who received the treatment had billions of T-cells extracted from their body, which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated HIV. The 'serial killer' cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer, and remain dormant until the cancer reappears. While the idea of receiving a dose of HIV may seem scary to some, Dr June says there's nothing to fear about the stripped-down virus used in the treatment. 'It's a disabled virus, but it retains the one essential feature of HIV, which is the ability to insert new genes into cells,' Dr June explained. Of the 30 leukemia patients who received the treatment, comprised of five adults and 25 children, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission. Seven-year-old Emma Whitehead was the first child to receive the treatment in 2012, and has been cancer-free for two years now. Dr June and his team are now looking at using the HIV treatment to attack other forms of cancers, and will be starting trials this summer for pancreatic cancer patients. Seven-year-old Emily Whitehead was the first child who underwent the experimental T-cell treatment in 2012 (left). She is still cancer-free two years later (right)","Marshall Jensen was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012 and has spent the last two years searching for an effective treatment .

Ed Farthing, a third-year English studies student also expressed his disgust with the recent proposals.

Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas . Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago . Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation.

'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions.

Anthony Lloyd, 17, was found by police with his pockets 'bulging' with stolen cigarettes and jewellery . A teenage looter who took part in the Manchester riots lied in court about being an Olympic hopeful in a bid to avoid jail. Anthony Lloyd, 17, who was caught with pockets bulging with jewellery and cigarettes during the riots in Manchester on August 9, was jailed for eight months yesterday. But now he could now be hauled back into the dock after falsely claiming he was a member of the British judo team in a desperate plea for leniency. A letter was even presented to the judge at Manchester Magistrates Court backing up the claim. Lloyd had managed to convince his unwitting legal team he was a promising judo star. His defence lawyer Estelle Parkhouse told the court: 'A custodial sentence would impair his prospects with the squad and being part of the Olympics.' But it has been discovered Lloyd has never performed for Great Britain at any level. Bosses at the British Judo Association said that while he is a member of a local club he is 'a million miles away' from being anywhere near the national squad. A spokesman said: 'Mr Lloyd has never represented us at any level and it's wrong for anyone to describe him as an Olympic hopeful. 'He represents a club but has never been in any GB trials or anywhere near any of our squads.' It is understood the case could now be re-opened if the court feels it has been misled.  Lloyd may now face further charges of perjury should judges decide to bring him back into the dock. Loyd was sentenced to eight months' detention and training for each count, to serve concurrently at Manchester Youth Court . He could also be hauled before Crown Court if the offence is considered serious enough. Lloyd, of Audenshaw, was stopped by police at 9.30pm at the height of the rioting in Manchester. Officers found him carrying £66 worth of cigarettes stolen from a looted newsagents and a collection of costume jewellery which he said he had picked up off the floor. During the case Lloyd's lawyer Estelle Parkhouse said Lloyd was part of the British Judo team . and was returning from training that Tuesday night when he heard about . the disorder and ventured into the city centre. She said he took jewellery that he had seen on the street and knew it had been stolen. She said it was his intention to give it to his girlfriend. Lloyd's parents and brother were in court to hear District Judge Jonathan Taaffe describe the case as 'most tragic'. The judge said he accepted Lloyd had led a 'blameless existence' and had 'an excellent future and was a talented sportsman'. But after reading glowing references the judge told him: 'It is my duty to impose a custodial sentence in this matter. 'The public have to be aware that people who choose to become involved in large scale public disorder, rioting and looting, will be severely punished. 'On this night the centre of Manchester and Salford resembled a battlefield and the public throughout the country were shocked and sickened by what they saw.' Lloyd, who burst into tears as the sentence was read out, said he had been stupid and had gone into the city out of curiosity. After the hearing Ms Parkhouse issued a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I am sincerely remorseful for my actions and would do anything to give back to the community what I have taken from them.' It is understood attempts to check the bogus claim were made by the defence team. But they were unable to contact the GB team as they were in action abroad.

Manuel Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, is also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Kelly Thomas, 37. Ramos' family and friends raised the $100,000 for the bond -- which typically is 10% of the bail -- to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County sheriff. Ramos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. ""By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it's that late in the morning,"" Amormino told CNN. Thomas' father, Ron, 55, of Cypress, California, objected to Ramos' release and said Ramos should have been held without bail. ""I don't want him released because he brutally murdered my son,"" said Thomas, who's a safety consultant for the construction industry. He was an Army Ranger in special ops for 10 years; a martial arts master, he now teaches hand-to-hand combat to Marines going to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Also charged in the Thomas case is Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. He was released last week on $25,000 bail. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men are among six Fullerton police officers -- all men -- who were involved in the Thomas arrest and have been placed on involuntary, paid administrative leave. The FBI is also investigating the incident for civil rights violations. Ron Thomas, the father, said Thursday he wants criminal charges against each of the other four officers. ""Even if he just stood there and did absolutely nothing, that's what he should be charged with. He didn't prevent my son's death,"" Thomas said. The Orange County district attorney's office said this month that no charges were filed against the other four because ""the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers."" Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation July 5 and died five days later. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Since then, two other allegations of brutality at the hands of city police have surfaced, both regarding unrelated arrests in 2010. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and fellow prosecutors viewed 16 minutes of bus depot surveillance video showing what happened in the Thomas case, Rackauckas has said. Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, the prosecutor's office said. The Orange County coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Ramos had made initial contact with Thomas -- whom he knew as a ""homeless drifter"" -- after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars, Rackauckas said. ""He lifted his fists to Kelly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting to ready to F you up,' "" Rackauckas said, using ""F"" instead of the full profanity. The district attorney said Ramos' conduct was unacceptable and ""not protecting and serving"" the public. ""Ramos had to know that he was creating a situation where Kelly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F him up,'"" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Taser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers. At that point, Thomas was making no audible sounds, indicating that he was ""down and seriously injured,"" the prosecutor's office said.

0071c3032bb2555ad11df4662be90094a643cb09,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- For five years, the horrible memory has lingered in the minds of Madrid's commuters, quietly riding their trains into the heart of the city. The pain is easing, but it's a nagging ache just the same. The rush-hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. It was March 11, 2004, during morning rush hour, that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines, unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. The attacks are the deadliest in Europe since the rise of al Qaeda. More than a year later on July 7, 2005, terrorists would stage bombings on the London transit system that killed 52 people and wounded hundreds more. The explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks -- sometimes placed under seats -- court documents say. The terrorists got off at various stations down the line, before cell-phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations. Police dismantled another bomb that didn't explode. It provided vital clues that led to arrests. Eighteen people, mostly Islamic militants, have been convicted in the attacks. Watch more on the anniversary . Juan Carlos Garcia, an engineer who took the train later that same day, said he knows a couple whose daughter died in the attacks. ""It was very tough, especially knowing it could have been you,"" Garcia said. ""Now, you remember it, but not the same as when it just happened."" Beata Sadecka, a regular commuter, says she rides cautiously. ""Every day, when I get on the train, I always ride in the last car,"" Sadecka said. ""I don't know why, for safety,"" she added, not quite sure of her motives. On one train, the first explosion was in a rear car and, as people ran forward to get away, they were hit by explosions in the middle cars, investigators have said. ""People remember the March 11th attacks,"" said Vicente Jimenez, a deputy editor with El Pais newspaper, ""and while conscious that the threat continues, you have to continue with your life."" Memorial observations were scheduled throughout the day, including five minutes of silence for the victims. King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were not taking part in the public events. A victims group called their non-participation a slight. But on this fifth anniversary, most commuters are just going about their business, with that nagging ache still lingering.","Spain commemorates fifth anniversary of Madrid train bombings .

Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef is serving a life sentence at the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing . The convicted terrorist who planned and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing - who has been in isolation for more than a decade - has filed a lawsuit to end his solitary confinement. Ramzi Yousef, 45, has been imprisoned since his capture in Pakistan in 1995 - two years after he killed six people and injured 1,000 others after detonating explosives beneath the North Tower. Since the September 11 attacks, the 45-year-old Pakistani national has . been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the . federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies.' Yousef says that despite good . behavior while behind bars, he remains in solitary solely because he is a . terrorist - which he claims is a violation of his due process rights. In . a letter to the prison's warden obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Yousef says: 'I . request an immediate end to my solitary confinement and ask to be in a . unit in an open prison environment where inmates are allowed outside . their cells for no less than 14 hours a day.' 'I have been in solitary confinement in the U.S. since February 8, . 1995, with no end in sight... I further ask not to be in handcuffs or . leg irons when moved outside my cell.' The Times reports that Yousef doesn't even see the prison's guards, who push his meals through a small slot between two steel doors. The only other inmate within the sound of his voice is reportedly a man who has killed others while incarcerated. In August, Yousef's attorney Bernard Kleinman said his client wanted out of solitary because he was 'lonely' - and claimed that despite the World Trade Center attack, the 1994 bombing . of a Philippine jet, a plot to kill Pope John Paul II and other plots - Yousef is 'no longer a threat.' Isolation: Since the September 11 attacks, Yousefl has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, which is known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies' Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated . Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down . 'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court at the time. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.' Yousef was sentenced to life in prison . after he was convicted in the World Trade Center attack, as well as a plot to bomb 12 American . airliners over the Far East. At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.' His uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 terror atrocities that destroyed the World Trade Center towers and left nearly 3,000 people dead. Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack . Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely . He fled to the Middle East the night of the . bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was . turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a . radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said. Since . 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved . for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the . country. The restrictions prevent Yousef from . communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his . lawyer, Kleinman said. For those visits, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through . Plexiglass. The prison is also home to Unabomber Ted . Kaczynski, Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nicholas, .

0075795e722ebab52dca94aa77e57d5697f3b5bf,"(CNN)In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts. ""Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch,"" Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. ""It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff? It's a corporate world!"" The looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores. But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years. Meanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in ""Shame,"" of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck's penis in ""Gone Girl,"" albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we've seen Ben Affleck's penis, who cares about some male model's? Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years. Perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor; that women are no longer required to do all the showing. That's not a bad thing. Maybe the ""Free the Nipple"" people are finally getting their way, and women will be able to parade topless around town, or at the gym, or wherever they please, without stares or stigma (or arrest), as men have done for ages. More likely, it's a clear sign that we're a culture so overexposed that we've got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn. We are becoming -- have become -- immune to that which was previously surprising/revolting/ awe-inspiring. It's amazing how quickly Lady Gaga went from outre to passe, isn't it? Meanwhile, Madonna is a faint middle-aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with pointy bras -- positively puritanical compared to the starlets of today. Consider their norms: Going commando -- that's ""without underwear,"" because, yes, there's even a phrase for it. Giving birth on TV. Posing naked for mainstream magazines. The Kardashian sisters spent the fall one-upping each other -- first Kim's naked backside on the cover of Paper (a sight credited with ""breaking the Internet"") and then Kourtney's naked pregnant belly (and backside) online at DuJour, because if one reality sister does it, so, too, must the other. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, continues to one-up herself, graduating from foam fingers and lewd gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in V magazine, the release of which she celebrated with a crude shoutout on social media. But what's next? What does she, or any of these women, do for an encore? Where does a jaded culture go from here for kicks? The envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits. What is left? Perhaps they'll think of something. You just know those ""Most Shocking"" shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die. You know that some starlet on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape (yawn) to arrange to be caught in the act. Or maybe we'll grow up and become more European in our sensibilities, and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast. Maybe we'll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath. Whatever the impetus, the bottom is in sight. After all, being outrageous today is hard work, and only getting harder. The payoff, meanwhile, has nowhere to go but down.","Peggy Drexler: Male models at Rick Owens' Paris runway show wore clothes that exposed their penises .

00759239d90551d978bbe5298d344fc0c1317dff,"(CNN) -- With thousands of jobs lost in the manufacturing sector and some of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the Midwest has taken an especially hard hit during this economic recession. Jobs are available in Wisconsin's brewing industry, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. In December, the Midwest posted the second-highest regional unemployment rate in the country, at 7.5 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Michigan, Indiana and Illinois all were in the top five states for total job losses. But, as CNN's affiliate stations report, there are some bright spots in the picture these days for Midwestern job seekers. Nursing, brewing and transportation promise to bring new jobs to the region. And, like elsewhere, government jobs have taken on a new air of stability in part because of the economic stimulus package. Nursing Dawn Jarvis, of Indiana, became tired of the ups and downs of the real estate industry. So she decided to seek a career in nursing. ""It doesn't dry up like real estate,"" she told CNN affiliate WRTV, of Indianapolis. ""You can take it with you wherever you go."" The station reports that nurses on average make upwards of $30 per hour. As America's population continues to age, health care is expected to be in increasing demand. The Indiana Health Care Association told WRTV that Indiana has the greatest need for nurses of any state. ""We have the highest vacancy rate for long-term care RNs [registered nurses] in the country, and it's significantly higher than other states,"" association president Stephen Smith told the station. ""One of the top professions over the next 20 years is going to be nursing and the health care field in general because of the aging of the population."" Read more about nurses in Indiana from WRTV . Brewing If you ever wondered what will happen to Wisconsin's brewing industry in this sober economy, Carol Nolen has a question for you: . ""What better thing to do than come home at the end of the day and enjoy a beer?"" the president of Capitol Brewery asked CNN member station WKOW. And for a person coming home at the end of a long day of job searching, perhaps even more so. The brewing industry is doing well as others tank, WKOW reports. All of the news from the industry isn't sterling. Some brewery stocks are down on the year, including those of SABMiller, the company that brews Miller products, the station says. But overall, WKOW reports that breweries are making money and keeping people employed. Read more on the brewing industry from WKOW . Transportation Being a school bus driver may not be the sexiest of jobs in the world. But it's better than being unemployed, Ron Reynolds told WISC in Madison, Wisconsin. Driving schools in the area are full, and transportation companies, which normally have trouble filling their rosters, are awash with interest from applicants who seem to be more qualified than in years past, the station reports. Jerry Klabacka, director of Diesel Truck Driving School, told WISC that the industry is hiring truck drivers now, but that could change if companies slow their shipments of goods. The transportation industry in Madison ""is recession-proof in the standpoint that it always needs people,"" he said. ""However, when production goes down in this country, so does freight."" For now, WISC reports that the local transportation sector in the area is seeing ""unprecedented growth."" Read more from WISC . Government Damian Givens attended a recent job fair hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau in Greenwood, Indiana. He told WRTV that it's ""refreshing"" to know that someone is offering jobs. The bureau, which takes a detailed survey of the American public every 10 years, plans to hire 900 people in the area by April 1, and another 1,000 employees next year, the station reports. All of those jobs pertain to the bureau's 2010 survey. Workers will be paid between $11 and $13 an hour, WRTV says. Since the turnout at the jobs event in late February wasn't high, the Census Bureau is still expecting applicants. Watch a WRTV video from the jobs event . ""We think there will be a lot more people, because jobs are hard to come by -- and the census is going to offer that opportunity for people,"" Dennis Sturdevant, of the Census Bureau, told WRTV. Chocolate In Anderson, Indiana, the chocolate maker Nestle is getting headlines for its decision to take a manufacturing plant back up to full capacity this week. ""The plant, which makes and distributes Nesquik and Coffee-Mate, has added hundreds of new jobs to a community desperately in need of positive economic news,"" WRTV reports. Nestle announced it would expand the plant by 880,000 square feet and had 100 more jobs, the station says. Originally, the chocolate maker had planned to add 300 jobs. Indiana's governor touted the 100-job expansion as a success in hard times. See a photo of the plant and read more from WRTV .

A mother-of-six was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from his  £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball. Karen Buckland, 39, put 'her life on the line' to save the 49-year driver after she found him slumped at the wheel at the silver GTC supercar as it was bursting into flames on his driveway. Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Buckland opened the driver's side door of the blazing vehicle then used all of her strength to hoist him to safety. As she did so the fire ripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle - leaving it a burnt out wreck. Wreckage: Karen Buckland dragged her neighbour from his £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded in to flames on his driveway in Marple, near Stockport, Manchester . Brave: Mother-of-six Karen Buckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her 'life on the line' to save her neighbour . The driver - a wealthy accountant with three children - was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood. Mrs Buckland was today commended for her bravery by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Mrs Buckland, from Marple, near Stockport, said: 'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. We weren't that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier.' Lucky escape: Mrs Buckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moment before the entire car went up in flames . Quick thinking: Mrs Buckland could smell electrics burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire . She added: 'My husband nearly had to . drag me to the awards ceremony - frankly I didn't know what the fuss was . about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put . on especially for me. 'The . fact is my 16-year-old our daughter Morgan was there too and she was . brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a . neighbour helped as well - and the crews were obviously also very good. Lifesaver: Karen Buckland grabbed her neighbour under his arms and dragged him away from the car . 'I was so touched and lost for words, . all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I did every day - . they are the real heroes in my opinion.' The . incident occurred when Mrs Buckland, who works as a director of . enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and and after . dinner realised she could smell burning. Mrs Buckland, who lives with property . developer husband Eain, 52, said: 'Eain was still at work, so Morgan and . I were watching television. 'I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble drier and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew. 'He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been revving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Bentley was on fire and the flames were spreading fast. 'He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen.' With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house - burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack - all Mrs Buckland could think about was rescuing the man before he burned to death. She said: 'I didn't reason, I just did it. I didn't think about myself or anything else; it's all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. As I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there.' Mrs Buckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Morgan called 999 and asked for help. Morgan took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room and crews from Marple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze and took over from Karen and gave first aid to the man. Presentation: Karen Buckland being presented with a County Fire Officer's Commendation with her husband Eain her daughter Morgan and Chief Officer Steve McGuirk . Mrs Buckland said: 'As he lay on the . ground unconscious, he looked in a bad way - he was singed, covered in . smoke and foaming and gurgling from the mouth. That image is hard to . forget. 'Even now I . drive up to our house, I can spot where the tiles have been replaced in . next door's driveway because of the damage - and what happens comes . flooding back. It's a constant reminder. Well-deserved: Karen Buckland pictured holding her award next to her proud daughter Morgan . 'It wasn't until later and I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was. 'Morgan had some flashbacks, but apart from that we've been okay - we're just happy he's alive. 'I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one. 'It's so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him. 'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him - if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story. 'I didn't think about the danger to me - you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself. 'The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis.' Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an 'over revving' of the car's engine. County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: 'It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Karen not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his. 'Karen put her life on the line - watched by her family - to save this man and let there be no underestimation of the courage and strength of character that such actions take.'

0076f01b59fbd43bb1f6fe3d00e70f30622befdb,"(CNN) -- There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare: . Mutual assured destruction. What it means is that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. Everyone will die. National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat: . War rooms. Battleground states. Attack ads. And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year's presidential campaign may turn out to be the dirtiest ever. You've already seen it in the wall-to-wall television commercials during the primary season; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive, you can expect the tone of the advertising to make sewage seem pristine by comparison. As Peggy Noonan wrote in The Wall Street Journal: ""With all the PAC money floating around, we've entered the Golden Age of mudslinging."" It's not that the candidates are incapable of high-mindedness; they are extraordinarily bright. But in recent years the mantra of high-octane campaigns has been that below-the-belt tactics work, and the rationalization has been that a candidate can't accomplish anything worthy if he or she doesn't get elected in the first place. Jim Rutenberg, in The New York Times, under the headline ""The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Race for President,"" wrote last month: ""The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges seriously."" That, he wrote, is looking like an unrealistic expectation, and thus ""Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol."" From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective. It never seems to stick. Carol E. Lee, writing in The Wall Street Journal: ""Neither side shows any signs of curtailing the negativity. ... One effect of such early negativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier."" Why does this matter? With politics more of a spectator sport than ever, what is the real harm in its devolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling? The harm is that it's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted. The metaphorical eye-gouging and groin-kicking of take-no-prisoners campaigns may be effective in grabbing voters' attention -- increasingly, watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to gape at a particularly ugly auto accident. But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it. In a front-page story in USA Today before the conventions began, Susan Page reported that a USA Today/Gallup Poll ""finds Americans taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago."" Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other. To an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons, voters say that they view both the Republican and Democratic parties unfavorably. When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes. This year, asked the same question, only 12% said yes. And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style. In warfare, the hoped-for impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace, however strained or uneasy -- it was, and is, a doctrine of deterrence. In politics, it doesn't seem to inhibit the combatants. A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president. But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process. There is a publication that has none of the glitz or dinner-party cachet of the national newspapers or television news networks, but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs. The publication is the AARP Bulletin -- circulation 22 million -- and its editor, Jim Toedtman, recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective. Under the headline ""Leaders, Try Greatness, Not Meanness,"" Toedtman said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying ""no interest in compromise,"" and quoted Allegheny College President James H. Mullen Jr. in characterizing the current process as ""a disgraceful stew of invective ... a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil, uncaring or, worst of all, unpatriotic."" Does it have to be this way? The editorial recalls John Adams, who ""could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress' decisions would be dictated 'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; by contracted hearts, not large souls.'"" Adams wrote, ""There must be decency and respect and veneration introduced for persons of authority of every rank or we are undone. In popular government, this is our only way.'"" When the country loses that, it loses something essential. Just what is it that we are throwing away? Toedtman's editorial concludes: ""Decency, respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years. We are surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance. The measure for our leaders must be their ability to rediscover that proven formula of sense, greatness and learning."" But what political consultant would waste his client's money trying to fit those sentiments into a 30-second commercial? Meanwhile, Election Day is less than 10 weeks away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Political campaigns resemble warfare's mutually assured destruction .

A gang of around 15 men surrounded the unmarked car as the officer sat inside, smashed its windows and threw in the bomb. Following the incident, the worst in more than a week of disorder in Belfast, the Northern Ireland Secretary attacked Loyalist mobs for ‘dishonouring and shaming’ the Union Flag.

The woman officer escaped unhurt but . the attack, on Monday, was one of several incidents across the province . which police said were being ‘stoked’ by social media. Yesterday Theresa Villiers told MPs: . ‘There is nothing remotely British about what they are doing; they are . dishonouring and shaming the flag of our country with their lawless and . violent activities.' Thirty-two police officers have been hurt and 38 people charged since the violence began. Rioters gathered at Broadway Roundabout following a protest over the decision by Belfast City Council to stop flying the union flag every day . PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George .

They . have been heavily criticised by nationalist representatives over their . leadership since the trouble first flared a week ago. The trouble followed a council decision to limit the flying of the Union flag to designated days only. Ms Long's Alliance Party has been blamed by the loyalists for supporting the nationalist SDLP and Sinn Fein in pushing through the vote to lower the flag. There were also protests  in Limavady, Co Londonderry, Ballyclare, Co Antrim, Ballycastle, Co Antrim and Cookstown, Co Tyrone where the car of a DUP member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ian McCrea, was surrounded by loyalist who were angry at his presence. Several roads in Belfast were blocked and at one stage police were also attacked with petrol bombs and fireworks at Broadway, not far from the M1 motorway. Last week Ms Long was told by police to stay away from her home and her office on the Newtownards Road because of fears for her safety. Constituency offices used by the party were also attacked in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim and Bangor, Co Down. Mr Robinson and Mr Nesbitt have already called for loyalist restraint, and according to a statement tonight they agreed to work on a 'joint basis with a view to urgently bringing forward political proposals to address widespread concerns across the community.'","Gang of men tossed petrol bomb in unmarked vehicle .

00790f55c293d0544e93bcba78bef3635e1f6a63,"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Taylor Wilson is going to create a safer source of nuclear energy, help reduce the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons, screen container ships for weapons and power manned missions to other planets. But first ... he has to graduate high school in May. Jack Andraka is going to bring his 3-cent screening test for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer to market -- an alternative to a standard $800 test. But Jack, 16, hasn't been to high school much lately and isn't even sure he'll graduate. The two teenagers with Justin Bieber style haircuts wowed the 1,400 people who attended TED2013 this week, fitting the conference's theme: ""The Young. The Wise. The Undiscovered."" They were among a number of youthful speakers who Time magazine's Ruth Davis Konigsberg called ""some of the biggest showstoppers at the annual event."" By contrast, some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful. Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon declared that the era of strong economic growth in the United States is over -- as America faces the headwinds of an aging population, debt, inequality and educational weaknesses; he argued that it's hard to foresee innovations that could have the transformative effect electricity, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine had in powering growth in the past century. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, calling for a private sector-funded ""race to the top"" among states, lamented the inability of Washington politicians to develop a national energy strategy. She got laughs when she noted that Congress' approval rating is worse than lice, root canals and Donald Trump (although better than that of gonorrhea and meth labs). TED.com: Granholm's clean energy proposal . And Lawrence Lessig, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, sketched an even starker picture of political dysfunction, a ""pathological, democracy-destroying corruption"" in which a tiny minority of Americans representing powerful interests use their campaign donations to determine which candidates survive the primaries. Even against long odds, Lessig said the problem is fixable if enough Americans organize to bring about change. There were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat. Jane Chen spoke about developing a lower-tech method to save the lives of premature and low birthweight babies in regions where access to incubators isn't readily available. Her social enterprise Embrace distributes a specially engineered and heated sleeping bag that provides babies the heat they can't generate on their own until they're developed enough to survive. Google CEO Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass, a smartphone-like piece of headgear that enables access to your contacts, your e-mail, your searches and your photos. His pitch for the device -- now being tested by a select few for $1,500 apiece and due on the market later this year -- is partly that it frees people up from the ""nervous habit"" of constantly checking their smartphone as they walk: ""Is this what you're meant to do with your body?"" TED.com: Amanda Palmer -- the art of asking . David Lang, talked of his Open ROV project, which markets an $800 kit -- using off-the-shelf parts -- for a remotely operated underwater vehicle that gives its makers the ability to explore underwater worlds in James Cameron fashion.

Stewart Brand, the 78-year-old technologist who came to fame as editor of ""The Whole Earth Catalog,"" introduced an ambitious plan to recreate extinct species, using DNA from museum specimens.

TED normally attracts an audience of the elite of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and venture capital, along with foundation and corporate CEOs, who pay $7,500 for the five-day event, which is moving next year from Long Beach to Vancouver. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers). TED stands for ""technology, entertainment and design,"" although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago. The ingenuity of this year's youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas. Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno. He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14. In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies. Rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine, Wilson's new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt. His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground. He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors. Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said. Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite. Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said. And most exciting to the young space geek, such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination, he said. Andraka, who's 16 and a high school sophomore, won the top prize in the Intel Science Fair competition for his cancer screening test, which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers, providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure. He told CNN in an interview that he doesn't go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projects -- including inventing an MRI the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $10 million Tricorder X Prize to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health. Andraka and Wilson probably don't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED. Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices. By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue. ""Thirty is not the new twenty,"" she said, urging people to ""claim your adulthood"" and start making choices. Spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, a 36-year-old whose new video ""To This Day"" has attracted 5.5 million views, offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve, many still carry a heavy burden. He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself. He spoke of kids being called names, making them feel like ""oddities juggling depression and loneliness"" and challenged them: . ""if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there's something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit""","TED2013 conference theme was ""The Young.

Kanye says that everything changed when Kim came into his life. Saving grace: Kanye reveals in the interview that his girlfriend Kim and their daughter, seen here together for the first time last week at his grandfather's funeral, has changed his life for the better . Not long after the pair confirmed they were dating, they also found out they were expecting a child.

'I had people say ""this is going to damage your credibility as an artist or a designer,""' Kanye explains. 'But I say ""I don't care, I love this woman.""

But when others look at Shazia they see something else: a misfit. Shazia dances for the cameras at a party. ""People start staring at me in such a manner as if an animal from the jungle has come into the city."" Shazia says. Shazia belongs to Pakistan's community of eunuchs. It is a term here that loosely refers to transsexuals, transvestites or hermaphrodites, like Shazia, who are born with both male and female sex organs. For Shazia what nature created, has made a life of hell. ""I get so confused. I feel very strange that Allah could have made me a boy, or he could have made me a girl, but this way, neither boy nor girl. This life is very strange. It is a bad life,"" Shazia said. ""I do not want to accept this life. Had it been legal to commit suicide I would have done it."" When she was a child, Shazia said she had no doubt that she felt more a girl than a boy.  Watch Shazia handle stares from men » . ""When I used to go to school there used to be benches for boys on one side and girls on the other; my teacher always made me sit with the girls."" she said. Shazia left home when she was in her early teens. She said it was to save her family embarrassment and shame. Like other eunuchs in Pakistan, she has lived in colonies. They are often shunned by their families and forced to make a living by begging or as prostitutes. The colonies can be brutal places, where young people are often beaten and exploited. When Shazia was 17, she says she was drugged and the head of the colony performed brutal surgery severing Shazia's penis. But Shazia has survived the taunts, the humiliation and the savagery; now she is fighting back. Shazia has formed an action group and is campaigning for eunuchs like her to get proper recognition. Right now her state identity card lists her as a male. She wants to be counted as a whole person. Shazia has found a champion, human rights lawyer, Muhammad Aslan Khaki. Dr. Khaki presented a petition to the Supreme Court, leading to the first register of eunuchs in Pakistan. The court has ordered Pakistan's government departments to carry out a survey and recommend measures to fully integrate eunuchs into society without prejudice.

007a3697265477abf9f8f467366a0303bec5a446,"It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. And it has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Obama administration's assertion that there wasn't enough information to deploy forces - deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack on September 11th and its aftermath . Scroll down for video . Revelations: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 11 . The lethal assault which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Fox News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the embattled diplomatic compound. However, they were told to 'stand down' and according to sources who spoke to the news channel were told to 'stand down' again after asking for a second time to help Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Woods and two others heroically made their way to the consulate which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attackers. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces teams . The quick reaction force which Woods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Sean Smith who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy which is two hours away, it is claimed that two separate special operations teams and air support were told to wait - despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operatives on the ground at Benghazi. If true these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticised for providing inadequate security for the consulate staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's claim yesterday that there simply wasn't enough information to responsibly deploy forces to Libya at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested backup from a Specter gunship to take out an attacker firing mortars. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the consulate attackers were firing from. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Carter Ham, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they couldn't 'put forces at risk in that situation.' A CIA operatives request for an AC-130H gunship to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied . Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . 'This happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyrone Woods and another former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrive. This new information comes as President Barack Obama's response to the attacks in Libya has become a contentious issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's truthfulness and competence. Obama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner, asked in a letter to Obama on Thursday about whether military options and assets were offered 'during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack.' 'Can you explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be pre-positioned, let alone utilized?' Boehner asked. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet anti-terrorist security team to Tripoli and had Navy ships off the coast. 'And we were prepared to respond to any contingency. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: As the U.S. consulate in Benghazi . came under a devastating attack last month, a rescue team of elite . soldiers was denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack . The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Obama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to 'the fog of war.' A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Center advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Ansar al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook for the attacks. U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November - after the November 6 presidential election - on security and intelligence issues raised by the September 11 attack in Libya.","Revelations shed new light on the effectiveness of the CIA at Benghazi and the level of support they were given .

At a Thursday afternoon press conference, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities identified the shooter as local Police Chief William McCollom, 57, and the victim as his 58-year-old wife Margaret who is now fighting for her life. As of now police have not announced as to whether or not they suspect the police chief of criminal activity but have said he is fully cooperating with law enforcement. Scroll down for video . What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom (right) shot his wife inside their home early New Year's Day. His wife Margaret (left) was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center . Scene: McCollom allegedly called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife . 'We have no leanings one way or the other at this point because we just don’t know,' Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said. “As soon as all the facts are known they’ll turn over a file to our office, and we’ll review to see if in fact there’s been any criminal activity.' Margaret McCollom has not been interviewed as of yet. 'He's very, very well-liked,' Mark Brown, of the Peachtree City Police Department, told CBS. 'The department is hurting. We're very concerned for his wife and the chief. We're just trying to make sure everything is done correctly as far as the investigation goes.' The incident happened just after 4am, when officers received a call from the chief, saying he accidentally shot his wife twice at their home on Autumn Leaf using his service handgun, a Glock 17 9mm. Investigators say the woman was shot in the home's bedroom. It was initially reported that the chief shot her two times, according to the 911 recording, but authorities now say she was shot just once. Margaret was flown by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was still listed in critical condition Thursday afternoon. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is taking over the case, and will file a report on the shooting to the District Attorney's office which will decide whether to press charges. GBI Director Sherry Lang said the police chief is being fully cooperative with the investigation. Meanwhile, McCollom has since been placed on paid administrative leave by the City Manager, pending an internal review. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said  McCollom has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He had only officially been in the position for two months, but took over as interim police chief in July when the previous chief stepped down. Veteran cop: McCollom has been the police chief of Peachtree City since October, but on Thursday it was announced that he would be placed on leave pending an internal review . Happy couple? One of the McCollom's neighbors described them as 'loving' and that he has 'never seen any problems over there'. William (left) and Margaret McCollom (right) pictured above in a picture posted to Margaret's Facebook. It's unclear what relation the young man in the middle has to the couple . Before that, he served as assistant chief and joined the department in 2012. According to Mrs McCollom's Facebook, she is licensed practical nurse who used to work in an emergency room. A neighbor who lives across the street from the McColloms described them as a 'loving couple' who 'do a lot of things together' and that he says he has 'never seen any problems over there', according to Fox. Peachtree City Police Lt Mark Brown said the department is 'hurting' after the incident and concerned for both the chief and his wife.

A singer was caught after knocking down a pedestrian in a stolen car - when her victim spotted her on X Factor. Paige Flaherty stole a pink Mini from outside a house in Jarrow, South Tyneside, and drove to Newcastle where she collided with Chris Brown at a pelican crossing. Mr Brown, who was left bruised, ended up with the wrong details for Flaherty after the accident and thought that would be the last he, or the police, saw of her.

007c4a5dfd21e5339f96c9c244c6c7d91168a4be,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- More than 340 fetuses have been found at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, discovered because the smell of decay drew complaints, police said Wednesday. Discovery of the fetuses, which came from illegal abortion clinics, have led to six morticians being detained for questioning, police Lt. Col. Chusak Kumsai said. The chief of morticians admitted receiving fetuses from several clinics, Kumsai said. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for cremation. The fetuses have been taken from the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. ""I think [the fetuses were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,"" nearby resident Puak Eiamchan said. ""So the temple can't receive any dead bodies to cremate for almost two months now."" ""I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they can't burn the fetuses and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell."" Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Pavena Hongskul, founder of the Pavena Foundation for Children and Women.","The smell of decay leads to the discovery .

007ddc6d5805b3c515bc2ca8843dcff28ec4903c,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can't afford to have a mayor who is getting 'on-the-job training.' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions . Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city's 'renaissance.' 'If the people don't want me, they don't have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. 'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I've accomplished.' Cianci's announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007 . Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence . He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won't keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice 'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head . The city's demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running. Lorne Adrain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci's candidacy represents,' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to 'keep moving forward.' Adrain said Cianci's announcement won't affect his campaign. 'The people of Providence are well familiar with his history,' he said.","Cianci served six terms as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island .

0080a94a2c7a15e2e9d6e1705510e1b2e662b894,"Security experts have warned Android smartphone owners to update their software and be wary of clicking untrusted links - as they could reset your phone back to its factory setting without warning. Researchers found that malicious hackers can create web-links that can wipe your phone - meaning all your files, personal details, images and music would be wiped, just by getting you to click on a web-link. The exploit has been tested on Samsung phones, but could potentially be work on handsets from companies such as HTC. The bug exploits a feature in many phones . from Samsung where clicking on a link can automatically dial a . number into your dial-pad and click 'Call'. The Galaxy S2 is likely to still be at risk from the 'link-jacking', which could reset a phone by following a URL - which can automatically dial 'magic codes' from your phonebook . While this is a handy feature in some cases - for instance, calling a restaurant directly from a web-page - it opens the door for malicious uses. Many manufacturers add hidden commands to your phonebook - for instance, dialling *#*#4636#*#* will automatically show you your phone's secret setting menus. But some manufacturers, including Samsung, add additional codes - and one of them automatically resets your phone, without any way of interrupting the process. The exploit was first announced by Ravi Borgaonkar, from the Technische Universitat in . Berlin. He said web links could be embedded in text messages, clicked on in a web browser, or scanned using a QR 'barcode' tag. When Borgaonkar announced his finding yesterday, he said there was nothing a Samsung owner can do to stop it. Android is rapidly becoming one of the most established operating systems in the world. This month - just before the iPhone launch on September 12th - Andy Rubin, the Google executive who founded Android, announced that 500 million Android devices had been activated across the world. The pace of adoption is rapidly speeding up - from around 500,000 activations a day a year ago, to 900 daily activations in June, to more than 1.3million activations a day by September. So far, there have been few serious security breeches for Android and Apple devices, in terms of causing a financial cost to the end-user. But as our phones become more widespread and become a bigger part of our daily lives - for instance, when used as a wallet to make payments - it is likely hackers and criminals will find new ways to target devices. However, the exploit only appears to work on some models, and Samsung has released a security update to block the problem. Samsung said there is a fix out for the flagship Galaxy S3 has already been issued, but has not referred to other models yet, such as its bestselling Galaxy S2. The spokesman said: 'We would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY S III has already been resolved through a software update. 'We recommend all GALAXY S III customers to download the latest software update, which can be done quickly and easily via the Over-The-Air (OTA) service.' Users can find updates by clicking on Settings | About Phone | Software updates. Some users also report the problem can occur on HTC handsets, but this is still under investigation. Developers for Android said they had also adapted the operating system to prevent the exploit. However Android's well-known slow update process - due to the varieties of different handsets, and phone networks insisting on adding 'bloatware' to their own devices - means this may not roll out to users quickly. In practice, few users are likely to come across a link which will affect their phone in this way, but anyone who is concerned should seek out an app in the Play Store called TelStop.","Samsung phones could be wiped if a hacker codes a website address to activate the 'reset' switch .

0080ea67d5fbfb2648a23ee827d84b80a9b0a37a,"(CNN) -- Ireland opened the defense of their Six Nations rugby title with a 29-11 victory at home to Italy, while England repelled the challenge of Wales to win 30-17 in Saturday's other match. Ireland, who won all five matches last year to complete a Grand Slam, led 23-8 at halftime in Dublin but could not run away with victory against a determined visiting team. Recalled flyhalf Ronan O'Gara became the first player to score 500 points in the tournament as he was successful with all six kicks at goal, while Jamie Heaslip and Tomas O'Leary crossed for first-half tries. Italy's only try came just before halftime, despite the sin-binning of center Gonzalo Garcia meaning coach Nick Mallett's team were reduced to 14 men, after a charge-down of Rob Kearney's kick by Kaine Robertson. ""It's not easy to click immediately having only been together for two weeks and not having played together since November,"" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll told reporters. ""There is plenty to improve on. It's the first one and job done. We'll take the positives out of it and move on. We showed an ability in the first half to turn defense into attack and the amount of lineout ball we won was a big plus. ""We made some good line breaks but didn't finish them off. Maybe we need to improve our support play."" England flanker James Haskell scored two tries to lift the pressure on head coach Martin Johnson, as Wales paid the price for Alun-Wyn Jones' sin-binning with 17 points conceded while the lock was off the field at Twickenham. The match was level at 3-3 when Jones was yellow-carded for leg-tripping England hooker Dylan Hartley, and the hosts subsequently scored a penalty and two converted tries, Haskell's first in Tests and another five minutes after halftime by scrumhalf Danny Care. Wales battled back to 20-17 down with eight minutes left as Jones made some amends by setting up prop Adam Jones for a try and then James Hook crossed for another. But four minutes later Haskell went over again thanks to Delon Armitage's interception, and then Jonny Wilkinson kicked his third penalty, this one from the halfway line to give the flyhalf 15 points for the match. Wales coach Warren Gatland was furious after Jones' indiscipline cost his side dear. ""We are frustrated and disappointed. We felt that was a game that has slipped from our grasp,"" the New Zealander told reporters. ""The yellow card has cost us 17 points -- it was one of those things, stupid. It was massive. Sometimes those things are very, very costly, and it was for us today. ""We had stressed discipline over the past two weeks and talked about giving nothing soft away, and it is frustrating we have done that. He has made an impulsive decision, and hopefully it is a learning experience for him and he doesn't do it again.""

The Army commander of a remote Alaskan base is under investigation for sexual misconduct, after allegedly allowing officers to have affairs and for permitting scantily clad women soldiers to pose for a calendar. Soldiers at the anti-ballistic missile base claimed  Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley had created a 'toxic environment' by turning a blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct. It was claimed that women soldiers at Fort Greely were also being allowed to trade sexual favors for favorable treatment from officers. Target: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley's wife, Tracey, featured as the August picture on a racy calender he approved of women at the base . Even if sexual misconduct is consensual, the Army forbids commanders to have relationships with their subordinates. Marco Morales, spokesman for the Space . and Missile Defense Command, confirmed the commander was under investigation in an email . obtained by Bloomberg. Incidents of inappropriate sexual relations between officers and soldiers had increased because no disciplinary action was being taken, according to three sources, who spoke to the news agency on the condition of anonymity. Lieutenant Colonel Miley declined to comment about the allegations when contacted by Bloomberg, referring the news agency to unit’s public affairs office. The spokesman there directed queries to the Space and Missile Defense Command. An anonymous complaint was made against Lieutenant Colonel Miley earlier in the year, after he promoted a racy calender featuring his wife Tracey as the August shot, alongside women from the base. An alleged inappropriate relationship had formed between the soldier who took the photos and one of the soldiers who posed in it. The owner of a bar near the base, defended the $25 charity calender for the American Cancer Society as 'tasteful' and said it had been selling well. Family values: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, with his wife Tracey, and daughter . Criticized: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, pictured with his wife Tracey and child, is accused of creating a 'toxic environment' Patsy Ewing, co-owner of Clearwater Lodge, told Army Times she had received no complaints about the calendar, which features a shot taken in her establishment. She added however, that the bar did not attract conservative customers. Lieutenant General Richard Formica, of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said the allegation would be investigated, but that he did not believe there had been any 'wrongdoing', according to the Army Times. He added that any potential impact on the command and its family readiness group would be monitored. In an email to Lieutenant General . Richard Formica, head of the Space and Missile Defense Command, soldiers . at the base complained that Commander Miley’s alleged condoning of sexual affairs left them fearing 'for our wives and even our children in this toxic environment'. At least 16 women serve at Fort . Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the . ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea. Military officials told NBC News that by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in effect, created an 'open season' when it came to sexual activity among troops. One official said: 'It's as if that was the only thing to do' at the remote base. It comes as the Department of Defense . increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this . month that the number of cases has increased in the past year. Remote: The Army's Fort Greely anti-ballistic missile base is located in the Alaskan wilderness . Defense: Fort Greely is a launch site for missiles capable of taking down long-range weapons . On Friday, President Obama called on . Naval Academy graduates in Maryland to 'live with integrity' to improve . trust in the military. 'Those who commit sexual assault are not . only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that . make our military strong,' he said at the graduation in . Annapolis. Figures released by the Department of . Defense estimate there were 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, . from groping to rape, in 2012. This was a 35 per cent rise in the number . of cases reported in 2010. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is due to . address West Point graduates on Saturday, three days after a Sergeant at . the academy was charged with secretly filming and photographing women . there. Two Army officers assigned to prevent sexual assault are also currently under investigation for alleged attacks, according to CNN. An Army sergeant first class, who . worked at Ford Hood's sexual assault prevention unit in Texas, is being . investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual . contact and maltreatment of subordinates. In Arlington, an Air Force officer . responsible for an assault prevention unit has been charged with sexual . battery after allegedly fondling a woman in the car park near his . office. Force for good: President Obama calls on Naval Academy graduates in Maryland to help restore trust . A Fort Bragg soldier who helps run . the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the North Carolina base, said sexual assault . damaged the strong bonds within the Army. 'This crime of violence, soldier upon soldier, it breaks your trust,' Sgt First Class Josalette R. Simmons, said. 'A lot of victims are young soldiers . who have left home for the first time and they come in thinking they're . going to be part of another, bigger family, then this happens. It's . almost as bad as being sexually assaulted by someone from your own . family, just breaks that bond of trust,' the 25-year-old who won . official recognition for her efforts, added. In an open letter to troops this month, Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno said the Army was failing in its efforts to prevent sexual assault. He said: 'It is time we take on the fight against sexual assault and sexual harassment as our primary mission.' Cases of sexual assault and . harassment were damaging trust within the force, the general said, . adding: 'These acts violate everything our Army stands for.'

0081d83c35c6822e64bdf61c878dfdce783294d0,"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- Ron Paul supporters have a plan. As they doggedly work the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that's markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to the podium. ""We want to change the Republican Party,"" said Chris Stearns, the Virginia state director for the Ron Paul campaign. ""We are making sure our people get in positions of leadership -- in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level."" Libertarians such as Stearns aspire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and anti-abortion forces in the 1980s. Many of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top rungs of the GOP now. And similar to that movement, Ron Paul and his campaigners for liberty are looking down the road. ""This is not just for this term,"" Stearns told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, ""but four, six or eight years from now."" Nearly 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate Ron Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. ""Four years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,"" said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New York to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral politics. He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia's 8th Congressional District. Battle in the grass roots . That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and pundits, but it's where Ron Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state's delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The 8th District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Arlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Four years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The 8th District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. This is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. Show up. Vote. ""We have been calling and e-mailing,"" Bailey said ahead of the vote. ""Our turnout's looking great."" But some feel it is an attempt at political hijacking. ""There are people out here who are still fighting for Ron Paul who got defeated at our primary,"" said Fran Redmon, who has been involved in the 8th District Republican Party for 40 years. ""It's so ridiculous. They should either be a Republican or not be here today."" Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Redmon replied, ""I think they aren't really thinking it through. I suppose they think we're people who don't have an agenda or something."" Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the libertarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second-ballot gambit . ""This is a movement,"" said Homan Rabie, who came to the 8th District convention with his high school friends, ""(Republicans) need a true philosophy."" They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. So it's a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Mitt Romney on the first ballot. Let's get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the 8th District convention mentioned a much-forwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstains, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Many Paul supporters told CNN they think it's a pipe dream. They're distancing themselves from the idea. ""To me personally, it doesn't look like any way that's going to happen,"" said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Tampa. ""I don't see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a ruckus. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat (if Republicans don't win in November)."" Change the party from the bottom up . Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention ""is not in my plan. That is against my plan."" The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginia's 8th District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Burrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Tampa. Stearns says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the up-for-grabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota's delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it's learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. ""We're all getting training on the ground now,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practice for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win."" It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but stamina.","Ron Paul supporters want bottom-to-top takeover of GOP .

00820005201f0513a5ff6defb5494c1c5160ef79,"By . Jack Doyle and Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 17 February 2012 . Theresa May will visit . Jordan in a bid to secure radical cleric Abu Qatada's extradition to the country, it was announced today. Qatada has been released from jail under . strict bail conditions while the Government seeks assurances that . evidence gained through torture would not be used in any trial against . him. But times is ticking because the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Shock: Abu Qatada's (pictured earlier this week) landlord has told of his shock after discovering the radical cleric is living in his house with his family and has been in touch with the lettings agent to have him removed . The Home Secretary said today: 'The UK and Jordan remain committed to . ensuring that Abu Qatada must face justice and are pursuing all options . with regard to his deportation and it is my intention to travel back to . continue those negotiations shortly.' Meanwhile the landlord of the house . where hate preacher Abu Qatada is living following his release from . prison has revealed he had no idea he was even there. The landlord said he wants the radical cleric out . and has already been in contact with letting agents who rented the . property out on his behalf. He said he had let the . house in Wembley, north-west London out to a woman and her four children . who had a different name to Qatada. But the 51-year-old cleric moved in with his wife and children to the £400,000 property after being freed from maximum security Long Lartin on Monday night. His release as the result of a European human rights ruling caused outrage after it emerged 60 police will keep tabs on him, costing taxpayers £10,000 a week . But the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Speaking after he heard the news the landlord, who cannot be identified, said he rented the property out on January 9 to a woman and four children whose name is different to Qatada. She signed a year's contract with a six month break clause. He said: 'If he is living there I want him out. I’ve been on the phone to the agents all day. They didn’t even tell me. 'I don’t want someone like that living there. It’s not good for me. I would never rent my property to someone like Qatada. 'This is not something I stand for, it is humiliating. I cannot believe it. I want Abu Qatada and his family out of my house.' Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet . The landlord added: 'I am shocked. I knew nothing about this.' He said he was called by a lettings agency in January saying the woman wanted to rent the property on a year's contract. The tenancy agreement was drawn up and he was told the woman did not have a husband. He said the woman claims benefits and is paying him £1,900 a month. It comes as yesterday a senior European human rights official has admitted Britain would face no real punishment if Qatada was put on a plane tomorrow. Thomas Hammarberg said ‘there isn’t really a sanction’ were the government to ignore the European Court of Human Rights and deport the radical preacher. The comments will heap pressure on Home Office ministers to ignore the court’s ruling and send Qatada back to Jordan. The radical cleric, described by a British court as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ was released on bail this week as a result of the Strasbourg ruling. Tory backbenchers have challenged Home Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to deport dangerous foreign nationals. Yesterday, in a further blow to hopes of deporting Qatada, a senior member of the Jordanian royal family appeared to pour scorn on the idea it would give in to Strasbourg’s demands. Speaking to the BBC, Prince El Hassan of Jordan, uncle of King Abdullah, said: ‘If this man has committed crimes which is presumably why he is being held in England, I don’t know what kind of court one has to offer to the Europeans. Does it want a juvenile court?’ No sanctions: Thomas Hammarberg, a senior official, said kicking Abu Qatada out would 'set a negative example' He added: ‘This is essentially a British European conversation and I don’t think democracy means that we have to appeal to every single European parliamentarian.’ Mr Hammarberg is commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, the court’s governing body. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper he accused ministers of not even reading the court’s judgement in the case. Asked what the repercussions would be if Britain ignored the court’s ruling, he said: ‘Someone may file a complaint and there would be a judgment that there’s a violation of human rights, but it’s more the bad example. ‘It would send a signal that the UK, which currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe, is ignoring [judgments] and that would be such a bad signal. There would be a chain effect.’ ‘It would set a negative example that would be used by other countries in Europe which are less keen on human rights. It would be extremely unfortunate to ignore the ruling. It’s a serious ruling and a serious matter.’ He added: ‘I have read the discussions in the UK and know that [Abu Qatada] is seen as a dangerous person. So I understand the heat but I’m not impressed by the arguments.’ ‘The key point in the [ECHR] judgment in Strasbourg is torture, but it seems that the arguments have become about whether Britain should co-operate with European institutions. ‘It seems the ministers had not even read the judgments. They mixed up the EU and the Council of Europe. It was about torture, not whether to co-operate with European institutions. Mr Hammarberg’s intervention is likely to inflame tensions between London and the council, at a time when ministers are trying to agree reforms to how the court works. Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet. The ECHR judges said Qatada could not be sent back because he would not get a fair trial in Jordan - because evidence could be used against him which resulted from torture. Home Office minister James Brokenshire travelled to Jordan earlier this week to attempt to broker a deal which would satisfy the ECHR. Mrs May said: 'The Home Office . Minister for Crime and Security, James Brokenshire MP, has led useful . discussions with the Jordanian authorities and talks with officials will . continue.' Mr Hammarberg said the court would need ‘watertight guarantees’ that evidence obtained from torture would not be used against Qatada at trial. His comments sparked fury in Westminster last night. Tory MP for Esher and Walton Dominic Raab said: ‘If Mr Hammarberg thinks Britain should go back cap in hand to the Strasbourg Court after this ludicrous judgment, he’s got another thing coming. In fact, since he is neither a judge nor an elected politician, he is pretty irrelevant to this debate.’","Home Secretary Theresa May to fly to Jordan in bid to deport Qatada .

008208e9995f28b903d54a64278449f8de4cbe61,"New Delhi (CNN) -- Let's hear it for ""the man of the moment, the man of the millennium."" That man is Narendra Modi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Prime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. ""Modi, Modi, Modi,"" chanted the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Modi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the Allphones Arena. ""You're a rock star!"" shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that #Rockstar and #ModiInAustralia began trending on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Modi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia -- almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. ""Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. ... India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,"" Modi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Modi really the man of the millennium? The hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Rightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, about a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, leaner and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk. In Hindi, in Gujarati, in English, Modi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, riffing on his key anthems at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platinum sales Indians now seem to expect? We're beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist Anand Mahindra told CNN that Modi's ""honeymoon period is over."" When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying ""people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate"" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Modi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Mumbai last month, Modi made a speech, played out live on many Indian TV channels. Curiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Ganesha -- who is depicted as having an elephant's head -- Modi claimed that Ganesha's half-man, half-elephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? The Indian TV anchor and journalist Karan Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. ""He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Make in India' state-of-the-art (defense) weaponry,"" Thapar wrote. ""These are 21st-century ambitions. How does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology?"" He added, ""The silence of the media is deeply disturbing. It feels as though it's been deliberately blanked out by everyone."" I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy only to portray Modi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rock-star levels of adulation. Modi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Modi's seven months as Prime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still subpar; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. So do Modi's fans.","Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister, continues to draw praise for his speeches .

The Catalans failed to win any silverware last season but  they are top of La Liga after eight games and are yet to concede a goal under new coach Luis Enrique this term.

0082f772bb8d19120e5df5a125a2da77fbc31679,"Fernando Torres scored in the first minute of each half as Atletico Madrid booked a place in the Copa del Rey quarter finals and ruined Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or celebrations. Back at Atletico on loan after an dreadful spell at Chelsea, the former £50m striker lashed a first-time effort high into the net past goalkeeper Keylor Navas to put Atletico 1-0 ahead on the night and 3-0 up on aggregate. The 30-year-old, included in the starting lineup in place of an ailing Mario Mandzukic, had never scored against Real at their Bernabeu stadium and, after Sergio Ramos made it 1-1, he restored Atletico's lead with a neat finish just after the interval. Click here for Pete Jenson's full match report . Host commentator . Simeone has pulled off a tactical masterclass at the Santiago Bernabeu. Torres' double proved to be significant as Atletico progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. Ramos and Ronaldo struck for the home side but they were unable to find a further three goals. Attention now turns to Barcelona's clash against Elche. Atletico Madrid are starting to control possession now. Real look extremely despondent. Not exactly a brave prediction but it does not look like Real are going to be able to pull the three-goal deficit (due to Atletico's away goals) back. They appear to have run out of steam with just under 10 minutes left on the clock. Ancelotti will have been extremely disappointed with his side's display today. His attacking trio of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema have failed to impress this evening. Just to remind you, Real need three goals in under 20 minutes if they are to progress to the next round of the Copa del Rey. The winners are likely to face Barcelona, who lead Elche 5-0 from the first leg. Benzema has to do better. The Frenchman blasts the ball over the bar from close range to the delight of Atletico's defender. Surely time for Hernandez to be given a chance. With 67 minutes gone, Ronaldo - despite scoring Real's second - has hardly had a sniff at goal. The Ballon d'Or winner will be extremely disappointed with how his night is panning out. Navas pushes a Griezmann free-kick over the bar. The away side have been able to get further up the pitch during the second half. Simeone's tactics have been spot on so far. Torres has been denied the chance of grabbing a hat-trick. Simeone has decided to replace his January signing with Turan. The former Chelsea striker was a staggering 250/1 to score a hat-trick before the match. This tie is just getting better and better. Bale crosses the ball to Ronaldo, who heads the ball past Oblak. 2-2 with 55 minutes on the clock. Torres worms his way into the box before the ball falls to Griezmann, whose deflected shot goes just wide. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Oh my, 37 seconds this time. Torres has silenced the Bernabeu. ""Fer-nan-do Torres!"" sing Atletico Madrid's 500 supporters.' Real Madrid obviously didn't learn from Torres' opener as the former Chelsea forward has scored a similar goal to his first. He links up with Griezmann again before slotting the ball under Navas' legs. Ancelotti does not have many attacking options on the subs' bench. He will surely turn to Hernandez during the second half.. Real's bench: Casillas, Varane, Coentrao, Khedira, Hernandez, Jese, Illarramendi . Simeone will be delighted with the scoreline at half-time despite the fact his side have been camped inside their own half during the first half. Torres opened the scoring inside the first minute before Ramos pulled a goal back 19 minutes later. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo's shot at goal appears to hit Miranda's arm. However referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz  waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo's shot at goal appears to hit Miranda's arm. However referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz  waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Karim Benzema has been extremely quiet during the first half. Ancelotti may decide to throw on Javier Hernandez after the interval. Atletico are finding it hard to get on the ball. The away side are hoping to hit Real on the counter attack, as they did with the first goal, but Real are not relinquishing possession. Real Madrid are still looking for a second goal. Ancelotti cannot fault the passion and effort of his players despite the early goal by Torres. 10 minutes to go until the interval. Atletico are doing everything they can to stop Real from going in front before the interval. They are finding it hard to get out of their own half due to the home side's eagerness to reduce the 3-1 deficit. Bale stretches his legs by bursting down the right at pace before picking out Ronaldo. However the Real Madrid man's effort at goal is deflected wide by Juanfran. Ramos has now scored six goals this season. A pretty good record for a central defender. Ramos really is a threat from set-pieces. He showed outstanding technique to head past Oblak. Ronaldo almost put his side in the lead, however his shot was cleared off the line by Mario Suarez. Momentum is building for the home side with 24 minutes gone. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Real Madrid need to repeat Champions League final scored here to go through and there is the first. Ramos from Kroos free-kick after Torres kicked Ronaldo. Curse of the commentator. Sergio Ramos leaps above Atletico's defence to head past Oblak and level the scoring. Game on! Atletico goalkeeper Oblak saves a Ronaldo shot from close range. The Slovenian goalkeeper will have to be at his best if he is to keep a clean sheet. 17 minutes gone and Real Madrid have not really peppered Oblak's goal. Diego Simeone will be delighted with his side's performance thus far. Griezmann, who set up the opening goal, appears to have a slight problem with his arm. Looks like he will be able to carry on though. Torres celebrated his goal in front of the Real fans, who didn't look too happy with the Atletico striker. Atletico are allowing their rivals to dictate play. The pressure is firmly on the home side after Torres' opener. Nearly 11 minutes gone at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid now need to score four goals if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the next round. A big task but anything is possible when you have Ronaldo, Bale and Co. Real Madrid will have been shell shocked by the speed of Atletico's goal. Torres, on the other hand, will take great confidence from his first goal since September 23. Fernando Torres has scored his first goal back at his former side inside the first 60 seconds. Griezmann goes on the attack before sliding the ball to Torres, who has the easy tack of placing the ball into an empty net. Ronaldo is currently on the Santiago Bernabeu turf - displaying his Ballon d'Or award to his home fans. Rodriguez, Ramos and Kroos are also showing off their trophies for being included in the world team of the year. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Mandzukic doesn't even make the bench having not recovered from a virus. Big night for Torres. Needs to stretch Real Madrid on the counter-attack as Ancelotti's team go for the big comeback. 'Big cheers as Bale's name is read out - Sunday's booing all forgotten. Ronaldo predictably gets the biggest cheer though.' Torres makes his second start since rejoining his boyhood side. It would be an ideal place and time for him to score his first goal back at the club. Bale's last match at his home ground saw Real fans jeer the Welsh winger for failing to pass the ball to Ronaldo. The former Tottenham star will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong against his side's rivals. Ronaldo, pictured arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu alongside Marcelo and Rodriguez, will be hoping to show why he was the worthy winner of the Ballon d'Or. The Portuguese superstar beat off competition from Messi and Neuer to win the prestigious award on Monday. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Madrid supporters packing the streets around the stadium as the team coach arrives at the Santiago Bernabeu. 'They need to overhaul a 2-0 first leg deficit against Atletico Madrid. Supporters will hold gold cards aloft before kick-off as Cristiano Ronaldo presents his Ballon d'Or to the home fans.'

His coffin, covered in white roses, was carried in a hearse with flowers spelling 'Daddy'. Relatives arrived in a fleet of more than a dozen luxury cars, headed by two black limousines. Mourners were driven to a private entrance of the chapel for the service which lasted around one hour, before the coffin was driven to the grave site within the cemetery for the burial ceremony. Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8. He had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. High profile: Mr Young, pictured (left) with his ex-girlfriend Noelle, became embroiled in one of the  nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with his ex-wife Michelle (right), 50, who accused him of hiding millions . Service: More than 100 guests attended the funeral of Mr Young at Kensal Green Crematorium . In shock: The exact circumstances of Mr Young's death remain a mystery and an inquest will be held this year . Tributes: The flowers and coffin in west London were accompanied by handwritten notes from loved-ones . Close up: Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side' Many of the father-of-two’s relatives and friends were driven to a private entrance to the crematorium chapel before his burial at the cemetery. In cold and bright weather, the hearse arrived carrying a mahogany coffin topped with floral tributes, including one made of roses from his daughters, which read 'Daddy'. Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side.' Another message said: 'Dear Scot, missing you badly mate and you will always be remembered.' One tribute spoke of their 'great memories' with Mr Young, adding that he was 'one in a million'. After the hour-long service, Mr Young's friends and family emerged from the chapel led by Noelle Reno, the star of Bravo's Ladies of London reality TV show. He also appeared in the first season. Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'. Family funeral: Around 100 people attended the service held at Kensal Green Cemetery this afternoon . Fall: Mr Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone (above), in the early evening of December 8 . Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs. He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone. When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'. Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.","Scot Young, 52, fell 60ft to his death from £3m penthouse on December 8 .

Appearing on ITV's This Morning opposite 18-stone plus-size model Rachel Cooper Wherry, Hopkins said overweight people are 'deluding themselves' if they think 'big is beautiful', and are using the line as 'an excuse for not wanting to do exercise and for eating as much as you want'. The pair appeared on the talk show to debate the topic of whether big can ever truly be beautiful, following comments from singer Alison Moyet, who shrunk from a size 22 to a size 10 only to confess she preferred being larger.

In answer to the debate question, . Hopkins said that all people want to lose weight and be thin. She said: . 'Overweight people are deluding themselves. It's an excuse for not wanting to do exercise and for eating as much as you want.' She continued: 'It's harder to be thin - you need discipline. 'Plus-size' is just a euphemism for fat - and who wants to be fat?' 'Big is not beautiful, because big cannot . find clothes they would like to wear,' she added. 'And I don't think we should teach . our kids that big is beautiful when it's not.' When she was asked whether it was a . generalisation to say that everyone would like to be thin, Hopkins . stated that 'life is easier when you're thinner'. Cooper Wherry - who, at 5ft 9in and 18 stone says she is 'extremely happy' with how she looks - said we should teach children about 'balance', and not to be 'obsessive'. Admitting that she probably would like to lose a bit of weight, she said: 'At the end of the day it's more about me feeling less intimidated about being a bigger person and enjoying my life. And not constantly trying to make myself smaller.'

0085ffb92f2b33b9dc68fd86388429efe9c77bea,"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season. Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia's first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco. Centre of attention: Max Chilton remains hopeful of being retained by Marussia for the 2015 season . Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Chilton. 'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don't really know where you stand until then. 'I won't focus on that until later on in the year, but I'm confident I'll be here next year. I've had good races this year. 'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we've got to the bottom of that. Overall I've been consistent and had good results.' Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. On track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season . Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham. If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. 'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Chilton. 'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. 'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking of the bigger picture. 'I've not properly looked into it, but I'd like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.'","Chilton is hopeful of racing at Marussia for a third straight season .

0087fadf3c9f54d10eb0db0b034d0d0c50c494e1,"President Barack Obama is getting off the island. In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests. Protective gesture: Obama walks with daughter Malia Obama to board Air Force One at Cape Cod Coast Guard Air Station in Massachusetts on Sunday . Back home: Obama and Malia are seen at Joint Base Andrews in Washington early Monday . Mysterious: The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington. He is seen here on the South Lawn of the White House with daughter Malia . In good spirits: Despite the early return, The President and First Daughter seemed to be enjoying a joke . Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises. Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas. 'I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Obama returned from his break along with his 16-year-old daughter Mailia, but is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend. In a first for Obama family summer vacations, neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father. Obama left Washington Aug. 9 with his wife, Michelle, daughter Malia, and the family's two Portuguese water dogs. The White House said 13-year-old Sasha would join her parents at a later date for ""part of their stay"" on this quaint island of shingled homes. But Malia will not be around when her younger sister arrives. The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Obama getting about a week with each one. Malia returned to Washington with her father  and is not expected to go back to Martha's Vineyard. The White House said Sasha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Malia left the island. President Barack Obama bike rides with daughter Malia Obama while on vacation with his family on the island of Martha's Vineyard . Obama often draws chuckles from sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls' lack of interest in spending time with him. 'What I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited,' Obama told CNN last year. Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. Obama's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha's Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama's foreign policy. Clinton later promised she and Obama would 'hug it out' when they saw each other at Jordan's party. No reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.","President Obama will head back to the White House on Sunday night as tensions rise in Missouri and Iraq .

0089064db0f5619d38cad4aa831cdd32e7616356,"Texas Governor Rick Perry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to his state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. 'There . can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too . high a price for the federal government’s failure to secure our border,' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon. 'The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head-on by . multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity, human traffickers and . individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas and . America.' According to a memo leaked late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month. Scroll down for video . Done waiting around: Texas Governor Rick Perry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico . Already, Perry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million. Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the memo reportedly states, and 'it is not clear where the money will come . from in the budget' other than 'non critical' areas like health care or transportation. The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. More than 57,000 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,000 will arrive by the close of this year. U.S. Border Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children. Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Barack Obama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president's plan. Roughly half of the money Obama's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries. Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from non-contiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process. The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the 'discretion' to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Obama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers. Perry held a news conference with Attorney General Greg Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the deployment. Perry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally . Also not included in Obama's request to Congress was funding for a National Guard deployment to the border - something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do. Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed at areas of high crime to help Border Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels. In a face to face meeting with Obama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago Perry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue but Obama resisted. Perry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down to the Rio Grande Valley to aid law enforcement officials. State Senator Juan 'Chuy' Hinojosa, a Democrat who represents border town McAllen, criticized the Republican Governor's deployment as unnecessary. '[The cartels] are taking advantage of the situation,' he told the Monitor. 'But our local law enforcement from the sheriff’s offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation. 'This is a civil matter, not a military matter. What we need is more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Border Patrol,' Hinojosa said. 'These are young people, just families coming across. They're not armed. They're not carrying weapons.' The leaked memo on the National Guard deployment specifically denies that it is a 'militarization of the border,' however. And Perry's office reiterated today that troops would 'work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials.' Hinojosa also accused Perry, who recently toured the border with Sean Hannity as part of a special for Fox News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border. 'All . these politicians coming down to border, they don't care about solving . the problem, they just want to make a political point,' he said.","Texas Governor Rick Perry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the border .

Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged. But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim. The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer. Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m . Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992 . Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home. Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale. The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house. It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland. It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated. Contentious: The pair fought over the luxurious mansion they built together in Thorntonhall, Glasgow . Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business . The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers. But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business. Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million. However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' Strathclyde University students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.","Couple who founded Ultimo in 1996 split passwords and number plates .

008baa186fecc3a0f957b01a8120a97bb93a535e,"A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims . Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly . She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. 'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. 'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. 'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse . Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH . Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. 'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while. 'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode. 'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.' Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home. She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes. 'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers. 'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly.

The four-time world player of the year scored two goals to give him 228 overall in the Spanish league, passing Alfredo di Stefano's mark and placing the Argentine into a tie for third with a man who, like di Stefano, made a name for himself at Real Madrid, Raul. Barring a serious injury and change of leagues, Messi -- who did miss two months this season with a leg complaint -- is sure to take over top spot from Telmo Zarra. The latter scored 251 goals, 17 more than Hugo Sanchez. ""I'd like to think that Messi still has a bit to go before he's 100 percent fit,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website. ""If he wants, he'll break any record he sets his mind to. ""He's only 26 years old and he'll lose count (of the records he breaks). Barca enjoy him and Argentina does as well."" Barcelona's awesome display against Vallecano prompted the Catalan club's website to use the word 'caviar' in describing the affair and the free-flowing football on offer served as a warning for Manchester City, which collides with Barca next week in the Champions League. Messi's goals came in the 38th and 68th minutes at the Camp Nou, with Adriano, Pedro, Alexis Sanchez and the returning Neymar chipping in with the others. Neymar, the Brazilian whiz, had missed about three weeks with an ankle injury. ""This month has been long,"" Neymar told reporters. ""I was very eager to play."" Despite the ruthless performance, Barcelona can't gain a significant lead over Atletico Madrid. Madrid earlier Saturday blanked Real Valladolid 3-0 at home, realistically claiming all three points with two goals in the first four minutes. It was relief for Atletico, which had lost three straight games in all competitions. ""It was convenient, fast and what I like is the intensity with which the team went out with,"" Atletico manager Diego Simeone told the club website.

A poll of nearly 72,000 people has tried to bring an end to the conflict – naming the festive market in Strasbourg, France as Europe’s best. With so much competition one of the most surprising inclusions on the top ten list may be Manchester, which placed ninth behind traditional favourites in Germany, Austria and France, but finished ahead of London. Europe's best: Strasbourg's Christmas market topped a vote held by a Brussels-based tourism group . Source: European Best Destinations . Billed by some as ‘the capital of Christmas’, Strasbourg’s market is one of the oldest in Europe, with the first being held in 1570. Today, organisers say it attracts two million locals and tourists every year. It topped the list in a vote held by Brussels-based tourism organisation European Best Destinations, and it was followed by Aachen in Germany, Vienna, Nuremberg and Lille. Rounding out the top ten were Dresden, Brussels, Cologne, Manchester and Prague. London was one of the options in the vote, which drew ballots from more than 80 countries, but it failed to crack the top ten. In an online poll, voters said they chose Manchester's market because it is traditional and modern and it ‘goes beyond the borders of the UK’. Councillor Pat Karney told the Manchester Evening News: ‘We’ve said it for years and now it’s official. 'Once again Manchester has been named the best Christmas market in the UK and one of the best in Europe and the world.' Manchester's Christmas market placed ninth, beating London as voters chose from 15 cities . The Christmas market in Aachen, German came in second on the list, followed by Vienna and Nuremberg . Mr Karney added: ‘We have welcomed visitors from across the world who have travelled to the city just to see the Christmas markets – but of course, once they are here, they fall in love with Manchester too.’ Open until December 21, Manchester’s Christmas market attracted an estimated 200,000 people on its opening weekend.

009030808b13ef12a2a19d59833d0e696ebeb68d,"(CNN) -- Jenni Rivera is being mourned as the Diva of Banda, after the musical superstar died Sunday in a plane crash in Mexico. She built a recording and performing career, several businesses and a devoted following -- and her life was as full of the ups and the downs as any of the characters she sang about. She was born 43 years ago in Long Beach, California, to Mexican parents Rosa and Pedro Rivera who named her Jenny Dolores Rivera Saavedra. In an interview with CNN en Español in 2010, Rivera spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at a Los Angeles flea market. When she was just 15 and a high school student she became a mother herself, giving birth to her first child, Janney ""Chiquis"" Marin Rivera in 1985. She then had two more children -- Jacqueline Marín Rivera and Michael Marín Rivera -- with her then-husband, José Trinidad Marín. Rivera spoke about how Marín physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college, he wanted her to quit school and be at home ""cooking and cleaning."" She said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back. They divorced in 1992 when Rivera found out Marín molested their daughter, Janney, and Rivera's younger sister, Rosie. Marín was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Divorced and on welfare with three children, Rivera worked in real estate and took a second job at her father's record label, Cintas Acuario, which led to her passion and career in Regional/Banda/Norteño music. Since the release of her groundbreaking debut album ""La Chacalosa"" in 1995, Rivera has released more than 12 hit albums, all reaching Platinum and Gold status in the U.S. and Mexico. Her heart-wrenching ballads often center on infidelity, social issues and relationships. One of her independent albums was ""Farewell to Selena,"" a tribute album to slain singer Selena that helped expand her following. Rivera married Juan López in 1997 and had two children with him: Jenicka and Johnny López Rivera. They divorced in 2003, and he then died in 2009. Then in 2010, Rivera married baseball player Esteban Loaiza but they filed for divorce earlier this year. Perhaps it was her personal struggles that made Rivera known not only for her music but for her strong, resilient attitude when faced with adversity. ""In Mexico, she represented a lot of ladies that can't talk about their feelings,"" Jose ""Pepe"" Garza, Rivera's godfather and friend of the family, told CNN en Espanol. ""The public feels represented by Jenni Rivera, and by the lyrics of her songs."" Garza is very well-known within the banda and norteña music genres and has worked with other big artists in the regional Latin music. He also gave Rivera her big break. Rivera was also a woman of many firsts. She became the first artist to sell-out two back-to-back nights at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California, in 2010. And she was the first female Banda artist to sell-out a concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California. The business mogul also started companies including: Divina Realty, Divina Cosmetics, Jenni Rivera Fragrance, Jenni Jeans, Divine Music and The Jenni Rivera Love Foundation. Rivera made her film debut at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival with the indie family drama Filly Brown, set to be in theaters in January 2013. Her fan base was only expected to grow with a show in development with ABC, confirmed a source with knowledge of the deal to CNN Entertainment. A multi-camera family comedy, according to Deadline, was expected to star Rivera as a strong, middle-class, single Latina woman working to raise a family, struggling to run a family business and manage her extended family -- all while fighting the cultural perception that she needed a man to do it all. ""It is very flattering when they tell me I'm a great artist and performer,"" said Rivera in a 2010 interview with CNN en Espanol. ""But I am a businesswoman, I'm primarily business-minded."" Breaking into a male-dominated music genre was not easy, but Rivera made it look that way with her endless perseverance. ""I think she just did it with her pantelones, and you need a big personality to do it. She's been through so much,"" said Damarys Ocana, executive editor of Latina magazine, in an interview with CNN, ""She's been a victim, but never thought of herself as a victim."" The drama that surrounded Rivera's life received just as much attention as her successful, career but that never stopped her from being a ""mama bear to her five kids,"" said Ocana. Family always came first for Rivera. Flashback: Jenni Rivera reflects on her success . In May 2011, Latina magazine put both Jenni and Janney Rivera on their cover, the first time the magazine put two people on the cover. ""We put both of them on the cover because they were the stars of 'I Love Jenni' and the show was doing incredibly well on Mun2,"" said Ocana. Rivera also spent part of her life volunteering at the Love Foundation, an organization that promotes programs to support immigrants, children with cancer, women victims of violence, reports CNN Mexico. In 2010, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence named Rivera as their spokesperson. Photos: Singer Jenni Rivera . Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday afternoon, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida described Rivera as ""a real American success story."" ""She was a singer in a genre of music that's largely dominated by males, and she brought a powerful voice to that genre where she sang frankly about her struggles to give her children a better life in this country,"" he said. Universal Music Group also released a statement, saying: ""The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Jenni Rivera. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Jenni was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed; but her gift of music will be with us always."" Also believed aboard the plane were her publicist, Arturo Rivera, her lawyer, makeup artist, Jacob Yebale, and the flight crew. ""It's hard to accept. It's painful. I cry,"" said Rivera's brother Gustavo Rivera in an interview with CNN en Espanol, ""But the support from the fans is consoling to us."" She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn't let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. ""Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,"" she said. ""I had to get off my feet, dust myself off and press on. That's what I want to teach my daughters."" In an interview with the Immigrant Archive Project she said: . ""If I had the opportunity to speak to a young immigrant girl that just arrived to the U.S. the advice I would have for her would be: ask, speak, search; because there are opportunities out there. And, know that you aren't the only immigrant or the last to come to this country. Many that have come before you have succeeded. It is possible."" Jenni Rivera is survived by her parents, Rosa and Pedro, three other siblings: Pedro Jr., Gustavo and Rosie; and her five children: Janney, Jacqueline, Michael, Jenicka and Johnny. Journalist Jaqueline Hurtado, Catherine Shoichet and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Sen. Marco Rubio calls Rivera ""a real American success story""

Mahbod Moghadam used his site, which lets users post notes interpreting rap and hip-hop lyrics, to comment on Rodger's exhaustive autobiography, which includes his reasons for killing six people in Santa Barbara, California, on Friday before apparently turning a gun on himself. In more than one note, Moghadam called Rodger's writing ""beautiful,"" and in another he speculated on the attractiveness of Rodger's sister. In a journal and in a video posted online, Rodger had expressed frustrations about not finding women to date and resentment toward couples who kissed in front of him. He also wrote that his anger toward women intensified after he overheard his sister having sex with her boyfriend. ""MY GUESS: his sister is smokin hot,"" Moghadam wrote. Moghadam also made comments about a girl Rodger described as the only female his age he ever saw naked. ""Maddy will go on to attend USC and become a spoiled hottie,"" Moghadam wrote, before adding, ""This is an artful sentence, beautifully written... ."" Rap Genius has removed the notations. But they were captured and reposted online by Gawker, Re/code and other news sites. Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter . On Monday, Rap Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman released a written statement saying that Moghadam had resigned. ""Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with annotations that not only didn't attempt to enhance anyone's understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny,"" he wrote. ""All of which is contrary to everything we're trying to accomplish at Rap Genius."" Lehman continued: ""Mahbod is my friend. He's a brilliant, creative, complicated person with a ton of love in his heart. Without Mahbod Rap Genius would not exist, and I am grateful for all he has done to help Rap Genius succeed. ""But I cannot let him compromise the Rap Genius mission -- a mission that remains almost as delicate and inchoate as it was when we three founders decided to devote our lives to it almost 5 years ago."" Lehman said the site, which describes its mission as helping users ""discover the meaning of rap lyrics,"" decided to post Rodger's writings in hopes that users' annotations ""will eventually be a good resource for people looking to understand this tragedy."" Part One of Rodger's writings currently appears on Rap Genius between breakdowns of the lyrics to ""Believe Me"" by Lil Wayne and John Legend's ""All Of Me."" In December, Google penalized Rap Genius after a user exposed what he called a scheme to manipulate search results and drive traffic to the site. The site removed the offending links and regained its Google ranking. As is frequently the case in today's digital world, the social-media backlash against Moghadam's comments was fast and brutal. ""Appalling use of technology by already questionable behaving site,"" Re/code co-executive editor Kara Swisher wrote on Twitter with a link to that site's story. ""What's most newsworthy about the story of the Rap Genius founder isn't that he was fired but that he didn't think his words were wrong,"" tweeted author and tech journalist Ed Bott. Observers also criticized Moghadam's own Twitter feed, which features many posts that could be viewed as crude at best and sexist at worst.

0090fab6c9e3b8eea64878eac047e8380d332c71,"(CNN) -- David Villa scores a dramatic injury time winner to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Sweden in Innsbruck to put them in the quarterfinals of Euro 2008 by finishing top of Group D. David Villa leads the race for the Golden Boot after his fourth tournament goal saw Spain defeat Sweden 2-1. The match had looked set to end in a draw after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalized following Fernando Torres' 15th-minute goal. However, a long ball out of defense dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Spain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and certain of top spot after beating both those teams. Torres had put Spain in front when he lunged at a pass from David Silva, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henrik Larsson had shot over the bar and Johan Elmander, who scored against Spain in a qualifying match for Euro 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Stoor curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the area in the 34th minute. The Inter Milan striker turned away from marker Sergio Ramos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Torres put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Silva chipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Joan Capdevila, but Torres stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his 16th goal in 51 appearances for Spain. Larsson and Johan Elmander both had their chances before Stoor found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Stoor's cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Ramos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right-footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 2-0 victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining a hairline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his hat-trick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the 38th minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Elmander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Spain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a nudge on David Silva just before halftime. Markus Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player's swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Spain. Sweden's attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Larsson just failed to meet Petter Hansson's cross at the far post in the 79th minute for his team's best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Silva's rebound in the 63rd minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Torres, whose shot was blocked. The teams seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-meter pass over the head of Torres and into the path of Sweden defender Hansson. However, Hansson lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angled shot from just inside the area. ""We're happy. We had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,"" said Spain coach Luis Aragones. ""In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out.""","David Villa scores an injury time goal to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Sweden .

Lewis Hamilton has come under fire from his hometown council following 'derogatory' and 'unfair' comments he made about Stevenage in the build up to last week's Monaco Grand Prix. Speaking ahead of the race, Hamilton, who was raised in the Hertfordshire town, claimed he was hungrier than his rival for the Formula One title Nico Rosberg because of his humble beginnings. The Briton, who finished second in Sunday’s race, said: ‘I come from a not-so-great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad’s apartment – and Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats and all these kinds of things – so the hunger is different.’ Under fire: Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by Stevenage MPs for making comments about the town .

He needs to remember his roots. ‘The council runs numerous schemes with the aim of providing opportunities for all our young people – from the academic through to the athletic and artistic types. His comments are unfair.’ Howard Burrell, Stevenage’s representative for young people, culture, sport, and leisure, added: ‘I think Stevenage is a great place to grow up and there was no need for Lewis to be so derogatory in his comments. It’s where he came from, after all. ‘I would prefer it if he chose to highlight some of the benefits of coming from our town as he is, without question, the most successful sportsperson we have ever produced. There is no need to say such things about his home town.’ Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points after the German secured victory around the streets of Monte Carlo in this most intense of championship battles.

Johnson is struggling with a hamstring problem and is effectively being rested by Australia, who carry a 2-0 winning lead into the final match of the series. With one-day matches against England and India to come, followed by the World Cup, Australia are determined to protect the 33-year-old Johnson to ensure he is available for the key matches that lie ahead. Australia's destructive paceman Mitchell Johnson has been ruled out of the fourth Test against India . Australia have already won the series 2-0, with the third drawn, and don't want to risk Johnson . Australia head coach Darren Lehmann said in a statement from Cricket Australia: 'Mitchell is an important part of our plans for the remainder of our summer and we want him 100 per cent right so won't be taking any risks with him. We believe it is best for Mitchell to take this opportunity to freshen up and get his body fully fit ahead of the Tri Series.' The fourth Test takes place in Sydney from 10.30am on Tuesday . Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: 'Mitchell had some right hamstring soreness during the Boxing Day Test and we have been closely monitoring his recovery since that match but feel he has not fully recovered. Johnson has an on-pitch encounter with India's new Test captain Virat Kohli in Melbourne . 'As such, he will not play in the upcoming Sydney Test match. 'We expect him to recover in time to play a part in the upcoming Tri Series against England and India.' Meanwhile, Australia captain Michael Clarke remains hopeful of playing in next month's World Cup after revealing he is ahead of schedule in his recovery from injury. A hamstring injury forced Clarke out of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Test series against India after the opening game in Adelaide in mid-December, allowing Steve Smith to lead the team to a series win with one left to play. The 33-year-old Clarke had initially revealed fears of never playing again, but is now well into the rehabilitation process following surgery, with Australia set to open their World Cup campaign against England on February 14.

Clarke has also been enjoying the commentary box vantage point for the series, as Australia drew the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne to clinch the series ahead of this week's final game in Sydney.

'I doubt many have dealt with the expectation, scrutiny, pressure and extreme adoration better than MS Dhoni. 'How Dhoni has managed to hold down the captaincy while playing all three forms of the game and wicketkeeping is beyond me. He's done a wonderful job and I think the hole he has left in the Test team will be hard to fill.'

Scientists at the observatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. ""We're seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,"" says Coombs. ""As that magma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also it gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activities were seeing now."" When the magma, or molten rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt. A siren goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire. Is the mountain erupting?  Learn more about Mount Redoubt » . ""That's just a little alarm. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,"" Coombs says reassuringly. ""It's a special kind of earthquake particular to volcanoes called a long-period earthquake. It has more to do with fluid and gases than with breaking rock.""  Watch Coombs keeping an eye on Redoubt » . Since the monitors first showed increased activity on January 23, the observatory has been staffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Lower 48 have been making their way north to help. Coombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. No one lives near the mountain, which sits on the Cook Inlet and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. ""Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,000 feet above sea level,"" says Coombs. She notes that at current weather conditions, ""it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage."" The ash is composed largely of silica, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines. But it is usually a nuisance. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets. ""For jet aviation, it's a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica-rich ash gets ingested into the engine, it can remelt and coat the insides of the engines and freeze up those engines,"" says Coombs. ""That's really the major thing we are trying to avoid here."" The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalled. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Coombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren't blaring, Coombs sends out the official Twitter feeds from the observatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months' pregnant. ""People have been joking, 'Are you going to name him redoubt?' "" she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitors.","In the cold Alaskan winter, geologist keeps watch on Mount Redoubt .

00971e34b7c8fb70119ac5c1886bf024b020dca1,"(CNN) -- A leading international children's charity has warned that Elton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. ""David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child,"" he told reporters. ""But having seen Lev today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home. I've changed my mind today."" While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message. James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: ""Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life. ""So it's quite well documented that these high-profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions."" Do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing? According to research by the charity's Web site, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Soviet-era children's homes. ""After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new 'gate-keeping' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution,"" Georgalakis said. ""So when a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. ""We will definitely be speaking to Elton and his representatives about this."" Elton John is the latest high-profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Malawi. Critics of the pop-star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of ""archaic adoption laws"" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. This condition was waived when Madonna -- and then husband Guy Ritchie -- adopted her first Malawian child, David Banda. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in UK each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: ""While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. ""We'll certainly be reinforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.""","Elton John, 62, made announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine .

Rangers face Derby County in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on May 24, with Harry Redknapp's side hoping to secure the £120m pay packet of Premier League promotion. But, should QPR return to the top tier at the first attempt, they could be forced to pay out more than half of that in fines under the Football League's Financial Fair Play regulations.

009ab18d1c06b1a31a98fa73b5124132d37555cc,"Another suspected suicide bombing struck the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Monday, killing at least 14 people and further highlighting Russia's security challenges as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics in less than six weeks. The explosion hit a trolleybus near a busy market during the morning rush hour, a day after a blast at Volgograd's main train station killed 17 people and wounded at least 35. Vladmir Markin, a spokesman for the country's federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks. ""This strike, which was cynically planned for the period of preparations for New Year's celebrations, is one more attempt by terrorists to open a domestic front, sow panic and chaos, and trigger religious strife and conflicts in Russian society,"" said a statement Monday by Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry. ""We will not back down and will continue our tough and consistent offensive"" against terrorists, the ministry's statement said, adding that such an enemy ""can only be stopped by joint efforts"" involving the international community. The approaching Olympics . No one claimed responsibility for the Volgograd blasts, but they occurred several months after the leader of a Chechen separatist group pledged violence to disrupt the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics that begin on February 7. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the bombings as ""a despicable attack on innocent people. ""The entire international movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act,"" Bach said in a statement, adding that he wrote Russian President Vladimir Putin to express condolences as well as ""our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure Games in Sochi."" Meanwhile, the United States offered its ""full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. ""We would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,"" Hayden said. Volgograd is a major rail hub in southern Russia and a main transit point for people traveling by train to Sochi on the Black Sea, just over 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the southwest. Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad. Two blasts in two days . Video footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it. The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses. At least 28 people were reported to be wounded, with several in serious condition, including one 6-month-old child, RIA Novosti reported. Based on the footage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus. The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber. Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Markin told RIA Novosti that DNA testing will be carried out on the remains of the station bomber, who used the equivalent of 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of TNT in a device containing shrapnel. Investigators said they also found an unexploded grenade at the scene. Video taken from an outside security camera showed a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building, followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out of shattered windows. Russia's security challenge . In July, Doku Umarov, the leader of the Chechen group Caucasus Emirate, released a video statement in which he vowed to unleash ""maximum force"" to disrupt the games at Sochi. The U.S. State Department considers the Caucasus Emirate a foreign terrorist group and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of Umarov. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the 2011 bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack. ""Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan,"" RIA Novosti reported Monday. The two young men behind the Boston Marathon bombings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack. ""Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,"" Rajan Menon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column. What might be behind the attacks? Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. ""This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the Games because of the myriad layers of security,"" Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told CNN on Monday. Other parts of Russia . However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policing the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan. With tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia. RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometers) east of Sochi. ""Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, 'We're going to try and disrupt these games,'"" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Monday. ""When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you've got to take them at their word."" The fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is ""not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,"" she added. Athletes are ""most vulnerable"" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said. Townsend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings. They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.","U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security .

009b92670e692dfa2056a70aad8fed9cff643346,"After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Elena, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. The siblings arrived earlier in the day at the Wild Animal Sanctuary, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, officials said. The lionesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds zoo in La Chorrera, outside Panama City. The sanctuary helped rescue the lionesses at the behest of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. The lionesses, at 200 to 225 pounds, weigh about half of what they should. ""Nobody really took care of them,"" Craig said. ""They got no medical attention."" Non-governmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The lions usually were housed in a 6-foot-by-8-foot concrete and steel cage in a zoo at the fairgrounds. ""These three girls didn't have a family structure,"" Craig said. ""It was more or less that they were isolated for (nearly) 15 years."" Wednesday afternoon, they were in a 1,500-square-foot temporary area at the sanctuary. ""They are in their enclosure, and they are resting comfortably,"" according to Craig. ""They are enjoying the space."" He expects that the lionesses will eventually join a pride of African lions that were rescued in Bolivia. ""African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together,"" Craig said. One of the big cats, Elena, is named for Elena Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescues in Panama. On several visits to the zoo, Castejon noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst. The carnivores, she said, largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance. Zoo visitors often bothered the animals and rattled their cages in the wee hours of the night. ""It was horrible,"" she said. Castejon credits ANAM with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds. The zoo also featured gnus, deer, crocodiles and turtles. After a protracted legal battle, the zoo was closed, with a mountain lion, two jaguars and an ocelot being temporarily cared for at Summit Zoo in Panama City. Jorge Garcia, a biologist and wildlife technician with ANAM, said the animals were being kept without proper permits. Over two weeks, La Chorrera hosts one of the biggest fairs in Panama, Garcia said, with school groups visiting the zoo the remainder of the year. Because groups that sponsored the fair and zoo changed every two years, he said, it was difficult for the government to force organizers to make improvements. It's important for government and animal rights groups to work together, Garcia said. ""We need to make alliances."" In February, 25 lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia were flown to the Colorado sanctuary, where they live uncaged. The flight, part of an Animal Defenders International operation, followed the passage of a Bolivia 2009 law that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The sanctuary built an 80-acre fenced site for the Bolivian lions, which are split into four prides, Craig said. ""They all have practically doubled their weight"" in the past seven months. The 720-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses about 300 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. Most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so they won't go into heat. That also reduces the competition and fighting among males. FedEx carried the felines from Panama to Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday and then to Denver early Wednesday.","Three sister lions are rescued from zoo at fairgrounds in Panama .

She posted the tweet on Saturday morning where she told fans she is due to be married after proposal last night . It is thought the pair dressed up for a romantic evening and a three-course dinner at their home in London yesterday. She posted a picture on Instagram last night of her meal of baked cod capers, cooked by her now fiance and father of their baby daughter, Belle Elizabeth, who was born in March this year. Alongside the pictures she wrote: 'Pretending we are going out for dinner! Cooking 3 course meal, dressed in our best clothes- all taking place at our kitchen table! Parents night in/out #nobabysitterneeded.' With her second snap she posted: 'I think my boyfriend has potential as a chef! Baked Cod with Capers,' before making the big announcement on Twitter today. The presenter posted this image on her Instagram last night where she told fans she was enjoying a three course meal at home with her boyfriend . Katie gave birth to baby daughter Belle Elizabeth in March this year. Her due date was Thursday, March 27, 2014 - the date of the six-year anniversary of when she was raped by her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch . The couple met after being set up by friend Juliet, who gave James her number. They shared their first phone call, which Katie admits was 'nervous and stilted' but they soon started to relax, telling each other about their jobs. The pair arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. 'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere,' Katie said. 'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either. 'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.' Katie, pictured at the TV Choice Awards in September, left, and at the Pride of Britain Awards in October, right . The couple soon started dating and became official before finding out they were expecting a baby in March, this year. Katie was just 24 when her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch organised for a man to throw industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. At the time, her modelling career was taking off and she had recently been crowned Miss Winchester in a beauty pageant. She had also begun presenting on small digital television channels, primarily shopping channels, and decided to leave her parents' home in Hampshire for the capital. It was here she met Lynch - a martial arts enthusiast - who had been tracking her media and modelling career closely. In October, the acid attack survivor was awarded an honorary degree at Anglia Ruskin University, in Chelmsford, Essex (left) and right pictured earlier this year . He approached her on Facebook and the pair decided to meet up in person in Reading, where Katie was working at the time. But two weeks into the relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater following a meal out, where Lynch raped, beat her and stabbed her several times in the arms. After eight hours in the hotel they drove back to her flat in Golders Green and she later sought medical treatment, though she was too scared to tell doctors what had really happened. Two days later, he persuaded her to go into an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account, where outside her flat she was approached by a man in a hoodie. She thought the man - Stefan Sylvestre, who Lynch hired to carry out the attack - was going to ask for money but instead he threw the liquid in her face. Katie, pictured before the attack left, and right during her recovery after she had acid thrown in her face . Katie has gone on to present television programmes, while her ex Danny Lynch has been jailed for 12 years . Writing in the Daily Mail after the attack, she said: 'When the large cupful of acid hit my smooth, soft, line-free skin, trickling down my throat and partially blinding me, he almost succeeded in extinguishing the last of the old Katie. Almost. 'In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships I’d ever had, trying to ingrain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss. 'I was sure I’d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved.' The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences - Lynch will serve a minimum of 12 years. She has since endured more than 100 operations to rebuild her face and set up the Katie Piper Foundation to raise awareness of the issues facing burns victims. Katie has also taken part in a number of documentaries and written her autobiography.","Katie Piper made her 'exciting' announcement this morning on Twitter .

Initially, a proposal by the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, to represent Australia at the overseas summit was blocked but Ms Bishop pressed on and eventually got her way after the full cabinet supported her bid. The Sydney Morning Herald says the minister for Foreign Affairs will arrive in Peru's capital, Lima, on Tuesday to meet with close to 200 other countries. She will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. There were no plans by Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured left) to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week but an uproar by Julie Bishop (pictured right) saw the decision reversed . The effort to bypass Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured) on global climate talks in Peru, shows evidence of latest tensions brewing in the government between Mr Abbott and his ministers. A recent poll has also shown voters lack confidence in the government on climate change . It's believed the request was approved only on the proviso Ms Bishop take another minister with her as a 'chaperone' which is trade minister Andrew Robb. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review before leaving, Ms Bishop said Australia needed to be represented at a ministerial level at the summit to show the country was taking the negotiations seriously. 'I think we need some successful outcomes, or some solid outcomes to set everyone up for productive negotiations throughout 2015 for an effective agreement at the end of the year,' she said.

A recent Fairfax poll found that more than half (57%) of Australians thought the government was doing 'too little' on the issue.

The Sydney Morning Herald has revealed that despite ministers repeatedly warning the Prime Minister's office against trying to shut down climate change discussions, advice was ignored. The re-visiting of Ms Bishops proposal to travel to Lima was a clear demonstration the cabinet wanted to get it right on climate change and put the controversial issue on the agenda unlike the G20.","A proposal by Julie Bishop, originally blocked, to travel to Peru for climate change talks was approved .

009e53253b0ba1823c4a08dfd6e4446ca9b02388,"(CNN) -- Big-spending English club Manchester City moved a step closer to meeting European football's financial fairplay requirements on Friday despite posting a loss of almost $160 million for last season. City's deficit of £97.9 million ($158 million) for 2011-12's Premier League-winning campaign was just under half that of the £197.5 million ($318 million) for the previous period -- which was the biggest loss in soccer history. The latest figure represents the fourth highest deficit in the English game -- three of which belong to City since the arrival of its Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. It can be contrasted with the $37 million net profit made by rival Manchester United in 2011-12. United posted a reduced revenue of £320 million ($517 million) for that period, while City closed the gap with a club-record turnover of £231.1 million ($374 million). Both are substantially behind leading Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona. Chelsea boosted by first profit in Abramovich era . It was the first time that City had breached the £200 million ($323 million) mark, and reflects the club's attempts to become more self-sufficient and avoid possible punishment from UEFA for failing to meet FFP targets. However, owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed still injected £169 million ($273 million) in order to keep the club debt free. ""It is important to recognise the personal and ongoing influence of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on the rapid transformation that is taking place,"" said chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak. ""The hard work of everyone involved at Manchester City over the last four years has begun to create an obvious momentum."" Last season City won the English title for the first time since 1969, and made a debut appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Manchester United seeks to cash in as sponsor DHL is sent packing . The club's revenue would have been higher if not for a group-stage exit from Europe's top club competition -- which has been repeated already this season -- but new chief executive Ferran Soriano was satisfied with the results. He joined City in September, having previously helped transform the financial fortunes of Barcelona between 2003-08. ""What I have found is a club on the verge of a historic transformation, reinforced by a genuine commitment to doing things well. It is a club with a rich history and the potential for an even brighter future,"" he said. With the FFP rules coming into play from next season, City officials are under pressure to conform -- or face the possible expulsion from European competition and a withholding of prize money. A 10-year stadium rights deal with Etihad Airlines -- owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family -- which also includes the club's under-construction campus has considerably boosted City's balance sheet. It is building an academy to try to avoid paying over the odds for star players in the future -- the £201.8 million ($326 million) wage bill for 2011-12 made City the first English club to break £200 million in salaries, according to the Sporting Intelligence website. That equates to more than $890,000 a day. ""The City Football Academy will strengthen the club's youth development and training capabilities, enable more players to move through the Academy and Elite Development Squads into the first team in the future, while bringing all of the club's operations together on a single site within the Etihad Campus,"" Khaldoon said. ""The responsibility lies with all of us to continue the hard work that will ensure that this is only the beginning of a long and successful era for Manchester City.""","English champion Manchester City posts loss of $158 million for 2011-12 season .

Residents in Hastings, East Sussex were kept waiting for the grand unveiling of the mystery star, with rumours circulating that local celeb and Madness frontman Suggs would be making an appearance. But their excitement was soon dampened when Chesney Hawkes was revealed as the guest to open the Christmas stalls and ice rink. People in seaside town Hastings, East Sussex, were left fuming after the 'celebrity' booked to open a Christmas market and festive ice rink was unveiled as one-hit-wonder Chesney Hawkes . Locals have now launched a Go Away Chesney campaign and took to the internet to vent their anger. One person tweeted: '90s legend. Will . be a bit long in the tooth by now – we’re planning a Go Away Chesney . protest when he arrives here – if anyone can recognise him.” Another wrote: 'Is this a joke?! If not, not exactly pushing the boat out.' Singer Chesney Hawkes has been revealed as the celebrity to open the Christmas market in Hastings, much to the dismay of locals . Hastings boasts several other singers and celebs who were either born in the town or live there now, who have had scores of hits, such as Graham McPherson, Suggs from Madness.

Simon Mills, 43, said: 'Hastings has a long line of celebrities, including Suggs and Andy Bell, so why in the world would Chesney Hawkes be chosen to open the Christmas market?' Another local called Wendy said: 'Is this the best we can do? 'Why couldn't we have Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart? Or even good old Cliff? 'The one and only Chesney Hawkes? - you said it mate.' Chesney, 41, is best known for his number one hit The One and Only, which topped the charts in 1991. Although Chesney has since dabbled with fame he now plays gigs at freshers week events at universities around the UK. He was due to take part on ITV1's skating . programme Dancing on Ice last year but after fracturing his ankle he . had to pull out. He was replaced by Chico Slimani.

Striker Higdon, 31, headed his first on 86 minutes from Jose Baxter’s cross and added his second four minutes later with a shot into the bottom left-hand corner to snatch a dramatic victory. MK Dons’ two brightest young prospects, both of interest to Premier League clubs, had combined to put their side ahead. Michael Higdon (left) of Sheffield United celebrates scoring the winning goal at Stadium mk . Higdon strikes to score his second goal that sealed a Sheffield United comeback .

Subs not used: Turner, McGinn, Kennedy, Dimaio. Booked: Alcock, Baxter. Scorer: Higdon 86, 90. Man of the match: Delle Alli. Referee: Roger East 6. Delle Alli, the 18-year-old starlet with a wealth of admirers in high places, enticed a foul in the box with an electric run before Benfik Afobe, 21, an on-loan Arsenal striker confidently netted from the spot for his sixth Capital One Cup goal of the season. Alli lit up the second round as MK Dons dispatched Manchester United 4-0. This fourth-round tie had little of the magic of that occasion but Alli again showed why he is being courted by the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal. MK Dons breakthrough came in the 66th minute when Alli was brought down by Craig Alcock and Afobe coolly slotted home. It was a rare moment of quality until the dramatic late finish. If one action summed up a lacklustre first half it was United defender Robert Harris’s free kick from 25 yards out in the 40th minute which he lamely lifted high and wide. MK Dons started brightly, with Afobe coming close to connecting with a looping ball into the box from Tom Flanagan in the second minute. Afobe admitted wanting to impress Arsene Wenger, ahead of his contract running out at the end of this season. Holding midfielder Alli looks a classy prospect and linked up well with Afobe. Alli sparkled in the second half, skipping away from challenges and creating space for his teammates. But it was the United who dominated the opening stages of the second half. Clough shook his head in disbelief as his side failed to score in the second minute after the break when a group of players in the box lunged for the ball but missed the chance to score. Clough again had head in hands when Stefan Scougall headed over by he was dancing with joy at the final whistle thanks to Higdon’s heroics. There was plenty of grabbing and grappling in the box in the second minute of the second half when several Sheffield United players were held by MK Dons defenders. This went unpunished by referee Roger East.

00a308681faf9c82a0e62a89b21fcdefb84b88fa,"Washington (CNN) -- Some voters are facing a choice this November: vote or be shamed -- publicly. Voters in Alaska received a letter this weekend from the ""Alaska State Voter Program,"" which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question: . ""WHAT IF YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, AND YOUR COMMUNITY KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED?"" Despite the official-looking letterhead, the ""Alaska State Voter Program"" isn't a government initiative. The mailer came from the conservative Opportunity Alliance PAC, which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election, the Alaska Dispatch News reported Monday. And the political group says it will follow up after the election, with plans to send out a new mailer that lists which voters went to the polls on Nov. 4. ""You and your friends, your neighbors, and other people you know will all know who voted and who did not vote,"" the group writes in the letter. The mailer could have an impact on the crucial Senate election in Alaska next week, where Republican Dan Sullivan is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps. One recipient of the letter told the Alaska Dispatch News she was creeped out when she realized she was Facebook friends with the 11 people listed in the mailer she received. It's not the first time groups have tried to shame voters into heading to the polling booth. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, sent voters in Virginia a ""report card"" last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box-- and their next-door neighbor's. ""You are one of the few individuals in your neighborhood that is not a regular voter. We're contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who doesn't vote"" the AFP letter reads, according to local NBC affiliate WWBT. ""Your neighbors who have voted in every election are concerned about our community's well being. They're concerned about the future of America...Are you?"" Voters in other states have received similar ""report cards."" Another group, Values are Vital, sent Florida voters a mailer this spring that even graded their attendance record at the ballot box and also shared their neighbors' voting track record. Liberal groups like MoveOn, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and America Votes have also pressured voters with voting records.","The Alaska State Voter Program mailed voters in the state this weekend .

00a570272e671a8fad94ffe0927a04c1bfc4110e,"Wasps euphorically claimed to have ‘got the monkey off our backs’ with this first away win in nine months, but Gloucester’s own pesky primate continues to weigh them down after yet another setback at home. There was a full house at Kings-holm on Sunday but the mood of festive cheer in the renowned Shed was soon wiped away. The hosts were desperate to atone for the emphatic loss at the hands of Bath at the same ground eight days earlier but instead they slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five home games in the Aviva Premiership. What was once an intimidating stronghold has become far too welcoming. Man of the match Andy Goode kicks one of his two penalties to add to his three conversions for Wasps . Wasps hit back with Tom Varndell providing the pass for Christian Wade to cruise in for their first try . While Gloucester remain ninth with persistent problems to address, Wasps have risen to sixth after their first victory on the road since beating Worcester on March 21. First-half tries by Christian Wade, Tom Varndell and Nathan Hughes came as an astute kicking game spread panic in the Cherry-and-White ranks. Despite Gloucester’s stirring second-half fightback, Wasps held on to claim a win which was arguably more significant even than the success on their first outing at the Ricoh Arena last week. Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We got the monkey off our back. Coming into this we’d won all our home games and lost all our away games. It was nice to get that away victory. ‘In the first half we controlled the game and I was really pleased. At half-time we talked about things we needed to do in the second half and we pretty much did none of them. We turned over the ball eight or nine times and put ourselves under pressure. We were really poor. ‘But I was pretty pleased with how we closed the game out. We found a way to win. It gives us confidence to go away and grind out a victory, especially in the last five minutes because I’ve lost count of how many games we’ve lost in the last five.’ Gloucester's England centre Billy Twelvetrees is tackled by Wasps' Ben Jacobs . Jonny May initially reaches just short of the line but continues his move to chalk up Gloucester's first try . England wing May composes himself on the slide before putting the ball down in the corner . Gloucester's Scotland international Greg Laidlaw kicks one of his two conversions - he also kicked three penalties at Kingsholm in the one-try loss . Wasps half-backs Andy Goode and Joe Simpson had Gloucester in disarray with their aerial onslaught in the first half, but only after Jonny May had given the home side a first-minute lead. When James Hook’s cut-out pass reached Mark Atkinson, he picked out England wing May, who cut inside to score and Greig Laidlaw converted. What followed was grim viewing for the Shed as their heroes unravelled in defence. In the ninth minute, Varndell broke through Steve McColl’s tackle on the flank and offloaded superbly for Wade to go over from close range. Goode’s conversion began his flawless return which yielded 12 points from three conversions and two penalties. In the 20th minute, the veteran fly-half’s high kick into the 22 bounced awkwardly behind Charlie Sharples and Varndell was able to gather and surge past the flailing McColl to touch down. There was a powerful riposte as Gloucester’s pack rumbled forward from a lineout for Matt Kvesic to strike but they were soon exposed again at the other end, in identical fashion, as the Wasps eight drove Nathan Hughes over to score. Varndell then bagged a five-pointer of his own after picking up a speculative kick from Andy Goode . Wasps turned down a kickable penalty before Nathan Hughes finished off a strong line-out drive . After a dressing-down at half-time, the home side rallied strongly and three penalties by Laidlaw brought them back to within a point on the hour. But there was to be no glorious comeback as Goode and Elliot Daly struck late penalties. Gloucester’s director of rugby David Humphreys said: ‘At the start of our year, one of our targets was to make Kingsholm a difficult place for teams to come but our recent results here haven’t backed that up. ‘After another home defeat, the long-term plan doesn’t seem as important as getting short-term results. We all know we are in a results business and we want to win. But we also know we have good players and there are aspects of our game that are improving. We are four months into a long-term project. The fans know that we’re not where we want to be, but they realise that we are a work in progress.’ John Afoa, Gloucester’s World Cup-winning All Black prop, delivered his own damning assessment, adding: ‘It was really disappointing. You look at the body language of the boys — really down and out. We let another game slip through our fingers. We are down in confidence. Maybe some guys are not making the right calls.’","Jonny May and Matt Kvesic scored Gloucester's two tries at Kingsholm .

A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of iPhones to encourage users to buy its new release. The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases . The study, compiled by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco, follows claims that the Cupertino-based company is deliberately sabotaging its old products. Writing for the New York Times, Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, described the results as 'striking'. 'Wouldn't many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one?' Mr Mullainathan wrote. ‘When you sell the device and control the operating system, that's an option'. The study then compared those results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and found the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung . While some MailOnline readers haven't noticed a slow down, others claim that Apple is sabotaging older phones through software updates. 'This is common knowledge,' one reader wrote. 'If you want to keep your iPhone running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out within six months of a new iPhone release,' Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product. She said her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Ms Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Her claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one. And Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before. Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product . A security expert has warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. However, Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes. His investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a ‘backdoor’ in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem. Meanwhile, in 2012 Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly. Ms Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. ‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. Dom Ferkin, managing direction of UK-based iOS experts, Creation Application, told MailOnline that he doesn’t believe Apple are doing this intentionally. ‘On every hardware release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time they are released,’ he said. ‘Each year they release a new iOS. If you’re running an iOS 7 on a 5 chip, for example, it’s comparable to running Windows XP on a Windows 95 machine. ‘It’s just enough to annoy the users, but it’s needed if you want the slew of new features that Apple releases each year.’ Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong. No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower. There are other explanations for why an older model iPhone may slow down, he claims. For instance, the latest version of the Apple operating system, iOS, is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as efficiently on older models. ‘Hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone,’ he added. ‘And you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.’ Apple is yet to respond. But Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong.No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower .","The study was undertaken by student Laura Trucco at Harvard University .

Miss Darlow, whose boyfriend and childhood sweetheart Declan Spreadbury, 22, is untroubled by her job, says the first dead body she saw was her grandmother's when she was 10. She said: 'People try to hide death from children, but I was exposed to it - I went to see her in the Chapel of Rest. 'I was encouraged to kiss her on the . forehead and say goodbye but sadly she wasn’t looking her best. 'I asked . why there were bubbles coming out of her mouth and the reply was that . she’d just come out of the fridge. I was just a child - but the image . has stayed with me.'

00a7132b9c9a646852ac4a606acb71e3a6acb8c6,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Beneath the cherry blossoms of Shiba Park, more than 2,000 people lined up for a Sunday afternoon march calling for Japan's nuclear power stations to be shut down. A week before, a similar protest -- though in a chilly drizzle, not on a warm, sunny day -- drew about 250. And a month of frustration, desperation and anger boiled over at Tokyo Electric Power Company's headquarters Friday as officials from towns around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant demanded to know when the crisis that has besieged their farming communities would end. ""The nuclear plant situation needs to be resolved as soon as possible. If not, we farmers will die,"" one of the officials, Iwao Suzuki, told the utility's executives. But the response from Naomi Hirose, the managing director of Japan's largest utility, offered little encouragement to the delegation or the rest of the world. ""There is a need to draw an end to the current situation as soon as possible,"" Hirose said, adding, ""We totally agree to this and are taking the utmost endeavors to contain the radiation."" Since the March 11 earthquake that ravaged northern Japan, workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been struggling to cool down three overheated reactors and keep pools of spent but still potent nuclear fuel from spreading further radioactive contamination across northern Japan. A month into the crisis, the utility acknowledges, there is no end in sight. The problems are so far ""beyond the design capacity"" of the plant that the Japanese are working in uncharted territory, said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. ""No nuclear power plant has ever considered the inability to get on long-term core cooling for more than a week, much less three weeks,"" Friedlander said. Some Japanese experts now say the effort is in danger of failing unless Japan seeks more help from international experts to bring it to an end. Tetsunari Iida, an engineer-turned-industry critic, said the situation is ""beyond the reach"" of Japan's closely knit nuclear establishment. ""A real exit strategy has to start with an inspection by the world's top experts on nuclear accidents,"" Iida told reporters at Japan's national press club last week. Engineers and workers so far have managed to stave off a complete meltdown in Fukushima Daiichi's reactors 1-3 and in the spent fuel pool of unit 4. But experts say the overheated fuel rods are likely to have suffered extensive damage, and there is a complication for seemingly every advance. Much of the past week was dominated by the attempt to stop water laced with massive amounts of radioactive particles from pouring into the Pacific Ocean -- water that comes out of the reactors ""screaming with radioactivity,"" Friedlander said. Tokyo Electric is now grappling with where to put the stuff, even dumping thousands of tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific to make room for it in a reservoir for low-level waste. In a normally functioning plant, coolant water is circulated out of the reactors and chilled. Then it's pumped back in to carry more heat away from the plant's fuel rods, which continue producing energy long after the chain reaction at the heart of the units has been stopped. ""You have to get the recirculation system up and functioning so they can cool that water in the normal way,"" said Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan and a CNN consultant. Normal cooling systems don't require the massive amounts of water -- around 7 metric tons (1,850 gallons) per hour -- now being poured into the reactors. ""That's a big problem,"" Was said. Tokyo Electric officials told CNN they can't say when they'll be able to restore those normal cooling. The first step is to get highly radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the units' turbine plants, then figure out how badly the equipment inside has been damaged. For the first two weeks of the crisis, engineers pumped seawater into the reactors. But the resulting buildup of salt inside has made it harder for coolant to circulate, U.S. nuclear safety officials advised in March. In addition, Was said, the fuel rods are likely in a state of ""partial melt,"" the extent of which will be difficult to determine. After 1979's Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, it took more than two years before operators were able to get a camera into the reactor to examine its condition, he said. Satoshi Sato, a Japanese nuclear industry consultant, called the current line of attack a ""waste of effort."" Plant instruments are likely damaged and unreliable because of the intense heat that was generated, and pumping more water into the reactors is only making the contamination problem worse, he said. ""There is no happy end with their approach,"" Sato told CNN. ""They must change the approach. That's something I'm sure of 100 percent."" After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst to date, the Soviet Union encased the plant's damaged reactor in a massive concrete sarcophagus. Iida said Fukushima Daiichi's reactors remain too hot to pour concrete, but he suggested pouring a slurry of minerals and sand over them to carry away heat before encasing them. And Was said the reactors have to be cooled in order to let the molten fuel harden again: ""Only when it solidifies are you sure you can contain it."" He said Tokyo Electric should be in the lead -- ""It's their plant"" -- but he added, ""There's a lot of different areas in which they could benefit from international help."" Japan's government is consulting with experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the French nuclear fuel company Areva, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the agency's chief spokesman. U.S. Navy barges have been carrying fresh water to Fukushima Daiichi, and Tokyo's foreign ministry has asked Russia about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. ""We already have quite a bit of support from outside countries and organizations,"" Nishiyama said. But he added, ""I think the most urgent issue now is support in whatever form possible with regard to how we can dispose of the cooling water and be able to build a sustainable cooling system."" General Electric which designed the reactors, and Hitachi, which built most of the plant, are also advising the government and Tokyo Electric. GE chief Jeffrey Immelt flew to Japan to consult with Japanese officials and executives last week, and Tokyo has asked Russian officials about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. But for now, Japan has ""no choice"" but to continue pouring water into the reactors, Friedlander said. ""I have no doubt that the men and women working at the power plant are indeed going to exert every human effort to make sure that they resolve this,"" he said. ""What I don't know and what I can't tell and the big question mark for me is, will it be done sooner than later? ""And again, my hope is, is that it'll be done sooner. But in order for it to be done sooner, TEPCO's going to have to step up and ask for more help from the international community."" Ailing Chang and CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","No timetable has been crafted for restoring normal cooling, Tokyo Electric says .

00a79ca59be700e845bf9e90bf08c5106b4a72bb,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- On April 20, President Obama challenged his Cabinet to cut $100 million in spending over the next 90 days. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says a report on Cabinet spending cuts will be released ""in coming days."" The deadline came -- and went -- without a report from the White House on whether or not that promise was fulfilled. Asked about the spending cuts, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday that information still was being compiled. ""Those are being reviewed now, and we'll release something in the coming days,"" Gibbs told the daily White House briefing. At time the challenge was announced, critics said $100 million in savings was a small amount on the context of the federal budget. ""Any amount of savings is obviously welcome,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in April. ""But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."" In April, Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort. ""Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money,"" Gibbs said. The issue is a sensitive one for Obama at a time of fierce Republican criticism about increased government spending for the economic stimulus plan. Republicans also oppose health care reform proposals by Democrats that would cost $1 trillion or more over the next 10 years. Obama is pushing for fast congressional action on a health care overhaul.","Obama's April 20 challenge to Cabinet: Cut $100 million in spending in 90 days .

Kim worked with Mackay at Cardiff City before the manager was sacked by  Malaysian owner Vincent Tan in December 2013 amid a storm of racist, sexist, anti-semitic and homophobic text messages in which he was implicated. The Football Association are still investigating the messages retrieved when files were seized from Iain Moody, Cardiff’s former sporting director, who resigned from his position at Crystal Palace when Sportsmail revealed the scandal in April 2014. Kim Bo-kyung says he is looking forward to working with Wigan manager Malky Mackay again . Among them were the use of the term ‘chinkys’ — in direct reference to the arrival of Kim — and a joke about Koreans eating dogs. The situation got worse when Wigan chairman Dave Whelan spoke about ‘chingalings’ as he defended his decision to appoint Mackay back in November. But Kim expressed his delight at being reunited with Mackay following his medical at the DW Stadium. The 25-year-old said: 'I am very happy to be joining up with the gaffer again. 'I really enjoyed working with him in the past and he helped me so much in my career. He gave me the chance to fulfil my dream of playing in England and I am now looking forward so much to working with him again. 'Since becoming a free agent, we had various offers but when the chance came to be with the gaffer again at Wigan, this really was the only place I wanted to come. 'The other players have all made me welcome already. The atmosphere in the dressing room seems very good, there is a nice feeling with all the lads and we now have to keep working hard to pick up as many points as we can and start climbing the league table.' Wigan manager Mackay has signed South Korea winger Kim as a free agent . Kim worked with Mackay at the South Wales club before the manager was sacked by owner Vincent Tan . Mackay came in for heavy criticism last year when the League Managers’ Association issued a statement describing the text messages as ‘friendly banter’, but the 42-year-old Scot later issued a full and unreserved apology. It was reported last week that he is likely to be cleared by the FA, who are believed to have a policy of not being able to act on communications sent privately between two individuals. Wigan, deep in the Championship’s relegation zone, sold Ben Watson, Shaun Maloney, Adam Forshaw and Callum McManaman during the January transfer window, which closed on Monday night. Mackay signed Leon Clarke on loan from Wolves and Sheyi Ojo on loan from Liverpool, and also snapped up the Cameroon defender Gaeten Bong on a short-term deal. His latest signing, Kim, scored his first top-flight goal in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United in November 2013, but has appeared just twice in the Championship this season and had his contract cancelled by mutual consent on January 24. The 25-year-old has won 30 caps for his country and was handed the No 7 shirt following the retirement of South Korea legend Park Ji-sung, but missed out on a place in the squad for the recent Asia Cup, in which they lost a thrilling final 2-1 to Australia in Sydney.","Kim Bo-kyung has joined Wigan Athletic until the end of the season .

One resident told KCRA that she welcomes the rain, because the area needs it. 'I love it, we need more of it,' another said. 'California's in a state of drought right now and we need all we can get.' Rain has been nearly nonexistent across much of California and Nevada since Dec. 20, halting hopes for the drought to improve. California's second snow survey this winter found the Sierra Nevada snowpack is far below normal after a dry, unusually warm January. A greater snowpack translates to more water for California reservoirs to meet demand in summer and fall. Water resources managers said heavy rain and cooler temperatures in the next three months would be required for the snowpack to build and give Californians hope for beginning to recover from the drought this year.","A windy storm sweeping down the West Coast knocked down trees, ripped through freeway and street signs, delayed hundreds of flights and knocked out power for thousands of people in California and Nevada .

00aafe70cc9129b3215b62c161d5692164a07494,"(CNN) -- Canadian aviation company Bombardier is taking a ""major bet"" on the notoriously cut-throat passenger plane market, spending around $3.5 billion to compete with well-established rivals Boeing and Airbus, its chief executive Guy Hachey says. The money will be invested in Bombardier's new C Series aircraft, which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers. Bombardier faces obstacles, including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis, which has hit the aviation industry hard. But the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been ""under-served"" by the major players, Hachey said. Watch: How to buy planes . ""So far, we've been serving customers up to about 100 seats, more in the regional segment. Now we're cracking into more of the mainline segment. We're investing about $3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment,"" he told CNN. ""If you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $10 billion on the rail side and $10 billion in aerospace. But it is a major bet for the corporation."" Cutting edge design . Hachey said Bombardier's competitive edge lies in the design of its planes. Until now, this market had largely been served by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. However these smaller versions of planes -- called ""shrinks"" --- were also much heavier. The other option was Brazilian company Embraer's E-195 -- known as a ""stretch"" -- but it cannot fly as far in one go. In comparison, Hachey said Bombardier's C Series will deliver an ""optimized product"" built specifically for the 100 to 150-seat market. On its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient, yet provide a ""best-in-class, wide-body cabin environment."" Taking on the major players . Bombardier's ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high, given the long history of Airbus and Boeing in these markets. Founded in 1942, Bombardier is a relatively new kid on the aviation block. The company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer. Its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people, with an annual turnover of Â£8.6 billion. According to Hachey, the company now has the scale to take such challenges. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit . Hachey is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat segment over the next 20 years. So far Bombardier has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft. Hachey, who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes, said: ""We feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards, so we are very happy with our position."" Beyond Europe . As European markets continue to take a battering, Hachey says Bombardier will be expanding its focus elsewhere. In the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries, with a renewed push in the U.S. ""In Europe typically things have been slower than usual, and this is a fortress market for us. We've been very strong in Europe so we are feeling the impact of the economic uncertainty,"" Hachey noted. Watch: Airlines brace for economic impact . ""The good thing is the rest of the world is not necessarily in the same shape. If you look at emerging countries we've been doing very well,"" he said. ""We're focusing elsewhere. The U.S. has also been picking up which is a very, very important market for us.""

00ac6fa0167e99167565ab9a12c1c96bf48ac414,"(CNN) -- An Iowa community was shut down much of Sunday afternoon while emergency crews remained hard at work, sifting through wreckage caused by a wave of powerful tornadoes that swept across the state overnight. The twisters caused major damage to about 60% of Mapleton, a city of about 1,200 residents, Monona County Sheriff Jeff Pratt told reporters Sunday. It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight, originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa. But despite causing extensive damage, it did not lead to any fatalities, said Stefanie Bond, a spokeswoman for Iowa's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. Wildfires in Texas | Flooding in upper Midwest . Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas. Initially, concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community, which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City. By 5 p.m., people were being allowed back in, though authorities remained on the scene, according to the sheriff's department. The high winds tossed cars and tractors, tore off roofs, caused a car wash to collapse, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries, giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere. ""There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town, but no fatalities,"" the sheriff said. Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County, according to a statement from his office. The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help. He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County, which also suffered severe damage. He then toured the tornado-ravaged town on Sunday afternoon, posting pictures online of uprooted trees and conversations with residents. On his Twitter page, Branstad wrote, ""Please keep the victims in your thoughts and prayers."" The twisters struck just before midnight Saturday. Amateur video recorded by storm chasers shows a large funnel cloud spinning across a flat terrain outside Mapleton. In the background, a passenger can be heard exclaiming, ""It's going to hit that town! ... Mapleton's in big trouble!"" Did you witness the storm? Share your story . Afterward, National Guard troops were brought into the area, according to Stefanie Bond, a public information officer for the state's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. She also said that natural gas service was temporarily shut off in the city. The Red Cross was also on the ground providing assistance. Bruce Spence, a government liaison for the group, called the damage to the town ""extensive."" ""The whole town is without power. Main Street is a disaster,"" he told CNN. ""They've shut down the town. As we speak, I'm looking down one of the residential streets. There's debris all over, trees are down. ""This isn't going to get fixed soon,"" Spence said. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night. At least three of the twisters, including the Mapleton tornado, caused significant damage, according to Boksa. In Early, a town of 1,600 residents, a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries in that town. In Schaller, a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles, the weather service reported. Tammie Pech, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims. Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday, Spence said. Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends, he said. The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha, possibly from a tornado. Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country, in central Iowa, and Kossuth County, in the east along the Illinois border. Three cities in Fayette County -- Fayette, Westgate and Maynard -- were without power for about an hour Sunday evening due to a blown transformer, the state's emergency management spokeswoman said. Randy Frank, Fayette County's homeland security and emergency management coordinator, said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through, with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening. ""Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control,"" said Frank, whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County. ""And it's that way across the state, with the wind, which (can) be very dangerous in (fanning) the fire."" CNN's Greg Morrison, Greg Botelho and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","NEW: A Fayette County official says fuel fires, fanned by strong winds, are a concern .

Drivers travelling from Gatwick who entrust their cars to firms close to the airport might want to check the credentials of the company before handing over their keys. Gatwick Airport parking firm Gold Parking is one firm which has allegedly been revealed to be a 'rogue trader' by BBC1 programme Watchdog. The BBC says the parking company was caught leaving holidaymakers' cars in random locations such as side streets and even town centres when they assumed they were being parked in a secure car park. A parking firm taking Gatwick Airport passengers' cars to 'secure parking' allegedly left them on side streets (File pic) One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned . The internet site for Gold Parking describes the company as 'the most affordable and convenient Meet and Greet Parking Company at Gatwick Airport' and claims, 'All our compounds are 24/7 manned'. One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned, while another reported that their Mercedes had been stolen. The show's presenter Matt Allwright and his team secretly checked to see whether the firm had a secure car park by providing three fake customers who handed over cars to Gold Parking. The customers were charged £90 for one week and £150 for two weeks to have their vehicle taken to the company's 'secure car park', but on each occasion the cars were left out in the open in Crawley, in communal public carparks, outside shops and in a residential side street. Exposed: Gold Parking, exposed by Watchdog on the BBC parked some cars in the Three Bridges Community Centre . Secure? Other cars were parked in a residential road in Crawley called Thatcher Close . Gatwick Airport has an approved list of parking firms and Gold Parking is not one of them . Crawley residents told the BBC they often saw unfamiliar vehicles left in the open for days on end. The BBC show, which aired last Wednesday, featured Dipesh Toor, who left his £45,000 Mercedes with Gold Parking and returned to find it had been stolen. The company told Watchdog it did have access to a secure compound which it shared with other companies. It claimed Mr Toor's Mercedes was stolen from within this car park. Brenda Jones left her Audi A7 with Gold Parking while on honeymoon in Cuba, and when she returned found the car was dirty, had a ripped tyre and an extra 1,500 miles on the clock. The couple subsequently received a parking fine in the post, stating the vehicle had been parked in a residents' parking space without a permit and two weeks later another fine arrived for a pay and display space. TravelMail was unable to contact Gold Parking on repeated occasions, and its website has been removed.

But exactly how many years does that foundation, mascara and  blusher knock off? Now research suggests that when applied well, it can make the wearer look almost a decade younger. The beauty myth: Respondents to the survey said Carol, 51, looked 53 with no make up, but just 46 - seven years younger - when she chose to wear a full face of cosmetics . Madonna, 54, took seven years off her 'bareface' age . Demi Moore, 49, lost six years thanks to make-up . Those who go out in their warpaint appear to be between five and nine years younger than when they are bare-faced. Kate Moss, 38, and Carol Vorderman, 51, were shown to have the most age-reducing regimes, with both looking nine years younger after applying make-up. Meanwhile, 54-year-old Madonna managed to shave seven years off her age and Cindy Crawford, 46, took off six. The research – which you won’t be surprised to hear was conducted for a beauty retailer – involved showing respondents images of well-known women, first bare-faced and then with make-up. Respondents were asked to identify a ‘make-up age’ and a ‘bareface age’, with the collective results making an average for each. Britney Spears, 30, managed to look five years younger with make-up on. Demi Moore, 50, was the only woman whose ‘bareface age’ was below her real age at 47 – but with make-up on she looked even younger, at 43. Respondents were also asked about their own make-up, with 70 per cent of over-30s saying it makes them look younger. 100 per cent of 60-69 year olds say they look younger in make-up . and... 73 per cent of 40-49 year olds . 62 per cent of 30 - 39 year olds . Of that, 36 per cent thought that make-up made them look one to three years younger, while 29 per cent thought it could make them look three to five years younger. An optimistic 2 per cent thought make-up took ten years off their real age while 18 per cent thought it took off five to seven years. Only women under 21 thought that a slick of black kohl and some lipstick actually added a few years. The survey by Escentual.com showed that the older you are, the more reliant you are on make-up to turn back the clock.

With their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - National Trust venues seem like the perfect family day out. But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes. In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country. The National trust has its eye on a different audience at the Killerton estate in Devon . Vintage: The National Trust hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd . The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences. To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’. Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame. ‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’ Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’ The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year . Two models pose on a vintage car. The trust hopes to give off a less 'buttoned-up' impression of its properties . The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes . Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50. The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure. Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district. It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’. Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image. She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’ ‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’ The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive. This is where the organisation  has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays.","Charity to host racy performances at 18th Century Killerton House in Devon .

Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it. Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis's spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S's, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable. Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict... John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140 . M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55 . Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection. Yes, they're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it.  You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work.  And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night. These trousers would be  flattering whatever your size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you'd sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection.  I'm not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version. These are creased even on the hanger and they're cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women.  One good thing is that they're properly lined, so at least your knickers won't show through the white fabric. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59 . M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59 . Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success.  The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it's limp on the hanger, so it's going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap. On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They've designed them with women's curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S's strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive.  The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they're almost the same price. However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there's too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side? WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers . John Lewis: Dress, £89 . M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35 . The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape.  The nautical look isn't overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman. Nautical stripes aren't a particular trend for 2014, but they're a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look well. Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It's too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy.  The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the seams.  Yes, it's cheap, but I just can't see many people looking good in it. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com . M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com . At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them on.  Though a fitted, white dress isn't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible. The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette.  Then there's the M&S version, which I really don't like.  Yes, they've picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps.  Then there's that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered. I'm surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20.  I can't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it.  And the final blow is that it's more than double the price of John Lewis's version. My advice is to steer clear. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59 . M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75 . The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line. It's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I'd say these will be on the sale rail before long. I'm also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top. I don't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store's normal range, there's often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una. The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look. WINNER: M&S .

Happy reunion: Four years after they were separated without getting to say goodbye, veteran Marine Corp Corporal Jeff DeYoung was reunited with the bomb-sniffing dog Cena who helped keep him and his fellow soldiers safe in Afghanistan . Since he was sent home in 2010, DeYoung has married and had two children. But the Muskegon, Michigan man never forgot the brave dog he'd bonded with at war. 'When he found the scent, he would lay down and would look at me,' DeYoung told ABC News. 'At that time, I knew within six feet of that area there was a bomb.' The highly trained, life-preserving purebred can sniff out some 300 kinds of explosives. But he had his protector, too. 'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn’t get harm. It was all about him.' Long separation: DeYoung left for home in April 2010 and hadn't seen Cena since . DeYoung served in Afghanistan with Cena who was his contract working dog that specialized as a improvised explosive device detection search dog . 'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn¿t get harm. It was all about him.' When DeYoung found out about Cena's impending retirement, he was connected with Mission K9 Rescue. The organization's president Kristen Maurer soon traveled from her home in Texas all the way to Raliegh-Durham International Airport on Thursday, where she picked up the pooch. Maurer then turned the car around and drove all the way to Detroit, where she'd make the reunion happen. 'The reunion was beautiful. They always are,'  Maurer told ABC News. 'Cena slammed her head into his chest once she realized who he was and she was so happy.' Here, DeYoung hugs Kristen Maurer of Houston, Texas who brought Cena, to be reunited with DeYoung.

A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police. Standoff: George Pickering, 57, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse with his pistol at Tomball Regional Hospital, sparking a police standoff . Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second . Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police. But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon.

While cars lay abandoned in the road, the unnamed pensioner ploughed on regardless, much to the hilarity of the bystanders filming him. The incredible video was shot in Arnhem, Netherlands, when it was blighted with flooding after the river Rhine burst its banks. The low-lying Netherlands has been fighting back water for more than a thousand years when farmers first built dikes to protect their land. Now a complicated network of canals and pumping stations cover the country keeping it high and dry. But as this video shows, a bit of flooding is nothing the Dutch can’t handle. The news comes as a British pensioner caused chaos on the M1 motorway by riding his scooter the wrong way down the hard shoulder.

00b287c19561791776e970936f96273b9ececc15,"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic extended his winning run to 37 matches this year as he beat world No. 1 Rafael Nadal for the fourth successive time in the Rome Masters final on Sunday. Second seed Djokovic triumphed 6-4 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes, despite having seemed to be on his last legs when he overcame Andy Murray in a three-hour epic the previous evening. ""I'm amazed with way I'm playing, especially today given the circumstances and the conditon I was in,"" Djokovic said after the match. ""I was able to perform maybe my best play on clay and I beat the number one in the world on clay. It's amazing, I'm going to enjoy this victory, but then I need to get ready for Roland Garros."" Blog: Djokovic's dream year shows no sign of slowing . He was given more time to rest when the men's and women's finals were delayed due to rain in the Eternal City, and Djokovic appeared the fresher of the two players as he stormed to his seventh title this year after another gripping battle. Nadal had ensured he will be top seed for his French Open defense starting in little over a week by reaching the semis in the Italian capital, but it appears to be just a matter of time before Djokovic takes his mantle as the top player in men's tennis. The Serbian is doing to Nadal what the Spaniard did to Roger Federer a few years ago -- despite their age difference of a mere 11 and a half months, it looks to be a case of out with the old king and in with the new. Djkovic turns 24 next Sunday on the eve of his bid to win a first French Open. He ended Nadal's two-year winning run on clay in Madrid last weekend, and this time he thwarted the Mallorcan's bid for a sixth Rome title in seven years. His aim will now be to stop Nadal collecting a sixth French Open crown, and add to his own tally of two grand slams -- both coming in Australia, this year and in 2008. Djokovic also won the Rome title three years ago, but he was unable to maintain his momentum. In 2011, however, he is within striking distance of John McEnroe's record best start of 42 successive wins set in 1984. As in the match against Murray, the final at Foro Italico was a see-saw affair with both players breaking each other's serve unexpectedly often -- but Djokovic had the power and precision when it counted most. Serbian's No. 1 dream is fast becoming a reality . He took a 5-3 lead in the opening set after an uncharacteristic miscue by Nadal, then dropped his serve and promptly returned the favor to take a 1-0 lead. He went 2-0 up in the second set but Nadal, winner of a record 19 Masters Series titles, showed he is far from a spent force by battling back to level and keep it that way until the 10th game. Djokovic went 40-0 up but Nadal saved three match-points -- but the five-time Rome champion could not escape the fourth one and fell to just his second defeat in the tournament. ""He's doing amazing things, he's very tough mentally and physically,"" Nadal said. ""Every week he's winning matches, he's playing fantastically, he's doing a lot of things very well and he has a lot of confidence.""","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic five wins away from matching John McEnroe's record .

A woman has spoken of the heartbreaking moment she was told she was infertile because she had unprotected sex with one partner as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, was undergoing exploratory tests in hospital to find out why she and her fiancé had been unable to conceive a baby when she was given the devastating news that she may never be a mother. She was stunned to be told her infertility had been caused by an STD she had contracted and been treated for as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, caught chlamydia when she was 16. When she started trying for a baby with her fiancé James Jackson, 30, she found the disease had left her infertile . Now, as she struggles to raise money for IVF, Ms Watson has made the brave decision to talk about her heartbreak in the hope that it will stop other teenagers from repeating her mistake. She said: ‘I was young and I made one foolish mistake that I will pay for forever. ‘That single mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life and I want other young women to know that when they have unprotected sex they are dicing with their future and their fertility. ‘My dreams have been destroyed because of something that happened five years ago but I want to talk about it to stop it happening to anyone else.’ Ms Watson thought she was being sensible when she protected herself against pregnancy before sleeping with a partner when she was 16. But after going for an STI test she was told she had contracted chlamydia. She was treated with antibiotics and put it behind her. She says: ‘I’d learned a horrible lesson at a young age, but what young woman doesn’t make mistakes? ‘I put it behind me and vowed it would never happen again.’ Ms Watson had treatment when she was 16 and thought she was cured. When she struggled to conceive tests revealed her fallopian tubes were irreversibly damaged . But Ms Watson was unaware that the damage had already been done. It wasn’t until she met James Jackson through her work in a care home, that she was to discover just how much her life had been affected by one mistake. The couple quickly became serious and Mr Jackson proposed. When they moved into their own home in Hartlepool, County Durham, the couple started trying for a baby. But after a year with no joy Jodie saw her GP in April 2012. Ms Watson and her fiancé are now trying to raise the money needed to pay for IVF treatment . Blood tests came back normal so she was referred to a gynaecologist in June 2012. She underwent a series of ultrasounds and X-rays in October 2012, which revealed blockages in her tubes. Ms Watson said: ‘I was stunned when they told us what they had found, but was not prepared at all when they said it was usually caused by chlamydia. I hadn’t even told James about it because it had happened so long ago, I thought it was in the past.’ But now it was affecting her future dreams of motherhood and Ms Watson was told she was infertile. ‘I broke down and cried. I just couldn’t believe it. I was ashamed, embarrassed and shocked. ‘I thought because I had been treated I would be fine but the consultant said the damage had likely already been done. I had no idea.’ Their only hope of a family lies in IVF but as Mr Jackson had a daughter with an ex-partner the couple do not qualify for treatment on the NHS. After being dealt the bombshell Ms Watson suffered with depression. She said: ‘I was just blaming myself every day and wishing I could turn back the clock.’ After researching her condition she read about an operation, which could help to unblock her tubes and increase her chances of becoming pregnant. Her GP explained there was just a 15 per cent chance it would work but gave the go ahead. Ms Watson underwent the operation in January this year but has still not become pregnant. Ms Watson wants to raise awareness about the dangers of unprotected sex as she says she regrets her decision every day and doesn't want other teenagers to make the same mistake . ‘They managed to partially unblock the right tube but the left was too badly damaged,’ she explains. ‘There is still a tiny chance I might fall pregnant so I cling to that but I know deep down the only real chance is likely IVF.’ Ms Watson applied to take part in an egg sharing scheme but was rejected because of the STD. At between £4,000 and £6,000 per cycle the couple are now fundraising to pay for IVF. She says: ‘After the bills there is hardly anything left to save so I’m doing what I can to raise the money including car boot sales. Ms Watson has also started a Facebook page to spread her warning to as many teens as possible. Ms Watson said: 'Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak' ‘I think it’s unfair that I don’t qualify for help on the NHS because my partner already has a child. That shouldn’t stop me from being a mum. I would like to see that rule reviewed. ‘Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak. ‘I know there are people who will judge me, but we all make mistakes and nobody regrets it more than me. ‘I wish I had never had unprotected sex and I wish I had known the full extent of the damage that can be caused. ‘I’m praying for a miracle and hope that one day I will get the chance to be a mother. ‘In the meantime I will do what I can to help other women by raising awareness.’ If it is not treated, chlamydia can cause long-term problems. In women it can spread to the womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes - this can cause a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility and persistent pelvic pain. It also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydia can also spread to cause inflammation in the fallopian tubes - this can make it difficult for an egg to travel from the ovary to the womb making conception more difficult. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis - swelling of the part of the man's reproductive system that carries sperm from the testicles. If left untreated, it can lead to infertility.","Jodie Watson caught chlamydia from a partner when she was 16 .

00b3cebdfa5caccbddb4c701689e2dfddd89a3d4,"Oscar Pistorius may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her, South African police believe. Detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Reeva Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’. This and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’. South African police are investigating whether Oscar Pistorius beat his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home . Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria. Police have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. Prosecutors have formally charged Pistorius with premeditated murder but the Blade Runner’s family say he firmly denies such a charge. Yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend Justin Divaris shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him: ‘There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva.’ Mr Divaris rushed to the house, where he said Pistorius repeatedly told him: ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ While no officials would comment publicly on the case, a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in Pistorius’s home started to emerge. Neighbours have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am. There were some suggestions, quickly denied, that the row may have been about Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with a rugby player. At around 3.20am, four shots rang out – apparently not all at once. The first person Pistorius called was his father Henke, 59. Shock: Pistorius appears in court charged with premeditated murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home . When he arrived, he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie-clad girlfriend down the stairs. She had been shot in the head, hip, . arm and hand. Pistorius – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to . save Miss Steenkamp’s life. Police reportedly found the bloodied . cricket bat in the bedroom. The en-suite bathroom door was riddled with . holes, a pistol holster was found by Pistorius’s bed and a gun cartridge . was on the floor. South Africa’s City Press quoted an . unnamed police source as saying: ‘The suspicion is that the first shot, . in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and locked herself in . the toilet. ‘She was doubled over because of the . pain. He fired three more shots. She probably covered her head, which is . why the bullet also went through her hand.’ The source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat. While one scenario is that Pistorius . attacked Miss Steenkamp with the wooden bat, it has also been claimed . that the model may have used it to defend herself. Rugby star Francois Hougaard's agent said the 'sad ordeal' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok's friendship with Miss Steenkamp . A third possibility is that Pistorius . used it to break down the bathroom door. Those close to Pistorius have . suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘save’ his dying girlfriend. According to this theory, the athlete . first shot Miss Steenkamp by accident, whereupon she fled to the . bathroom. He then shot at the door lock to try to get in, accidentally . killing her. Pistorius’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes. While he admitted that he had not . talked to his son in detail about what happened, he said he had ‘zero . doubt’ that the sportsman thought Miss Steenkamp was an intruder. A more likely defence from Pistorius is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her. Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics . Some in South Africa have speculated . about the nature of Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with Springbok rugby . player Francois Hougaard, and whether this played a part in the tragedy. The 24-year-old was keen to distance . himself from such reports at the weekend. His agent said: ‘This whole . sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him.’ Last night Pistorius’s agent said he had withdrawn him  from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him. The tragedy has also cast fresh light on Pistorius’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry. Miss Steenkamp's father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' As well as owning a pistol and . machine gun, at the time of Miss Steenkamp’s death he reportedly had . seven outstanding firearm licence applications. One was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent Sandy Hook school massacre in the US. Pistorius, who was charged with . premeditated murder at a court appearance on Friday, spent the weekend . in a police cell ahead of a second hearing planned for tomorrow at which . his lawyers are expected to ask for bail. Police say they will oppose the request. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","South African police reportedly found a bloodied cricket bat at his home .

00b4620df3af0867c75d25f09ded465961d0606d,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Implementing smoke-free policies can lead to fewer hospitalizations resulting from heart attacks, according to a new study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new study says smoking ordinances can lead to fewer hospitalizations from heart attacks. Researchers studied the impact of smoke-free ordinances implemented in Pueblo, Colorado, in July 2003. They compared the number of hospitalizations for heart attacks 18 months before the policy went into effect and three years after implementation. The Pueblo Heart Study found that although 399 people were hospitalized for heart attacks before any smoke-free laws went into effect, that number dropped to 237 three years after the law's introduction, a 41 percent decline. The study was published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Wednesday. The accompanying editorial suggests that there may be several reasons the ordinance may have led to a reduction in the number of heart attack-related hospitalizations: . • The ordinance led to an immediate decrease in secondhand smoke exposure. • People who were forced to comply with smoke-free rules in public may have adopted a smoke-free environment at home and thus reduced the exposure to secondhand smoke even more. • Restrictions to where you can smoke may have led more people to quit smoking altogether. While the Colorado researcher didn't know if the study participants were smokers or non-smokers, the CDC's editorial points out that the new study adds to research from eight other studies, which also saw a drop in heart attack related hospitalizations after smoke-free laws are enforced. A 2006 Surgeon General report concluded that ""exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer."" According to the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, secondhand smoke is the combination of two types of smoke that is produced when burning tobacco: the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or pipe and the smoke that is exhaled by the smoker. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human cancer-causing agent. According to the cancer institute, there is no safe level of secondhand smoke, and it can have an immediate effect ""on a person's heart and blood vessels."" It may raise the risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths annually, according to the NCI Web site.","Researchers studied effects of anti-smoking ordinances in Colorado .

Rep Bobby Rush, a Chicago Democrat, is the latest high-profile figure to don a hooded sweatshirt to protest racial profiling and discrimination. The garment, which the Florida 17-year-old was wearing when he was killed last month, has become a political statement for protestors, who believe Trayvon was targeted for being a young black man wearing a hoodie. Scroll down for video... Protest: Illinois Rep Bobby Rush removed his suit jack to reveal a hoody underneath and put the hood over his head as a symbolic show of support for Trayvon Martin . Out of order: Rush was quickly escorted away from the podium and as the acting speaker slammed down his gavel . The Congressman's protest comes as it was revealed Trayvon's girlfriend, 17, had to be hospitalized when she learned that she was the last person to talk to him before his death, according to Radar Online, citing an anonymous source. Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on the phone as he walked back to his father's home after picking up Skittles and a iced tea. Days after the shooting, following Trayvon's wake, his family's lawyer spokes with the girl to get information about what she heard. When he informed her she was last person to speak to him alive, she became 'absolutely inconsolable and had trouble breathing so her mother took her to a nearby hospital emergency room,' the source told Radar Online. In Washington, Rush took the podium wearing a suit coat. Halfway through his speech Wednesday morning, he took off the jack, revealing a gray sweatshirt underneath, and put the hood over his head. Hallowed halls: Rush (lower left) was led away after acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper (center) began pounding his gavel and called Rush out of order . Political statement: Hoodies have become symbols of racial profiling and discrimination, protestors say, after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed while wearing one . Justified? George Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon in self defense after being attacked by the teen . 'Just because someone wears a hoodie, does not make them a hoodlum,' he said. The . acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, began . bagining his gavel and ruled Rush out of order almost immediately. Rush was escorted away by staffers. The US House has a longstanding policy against wearing hats on the floor. 'I . applaud the young people all across the land who are making a statement . about hoodie, about the real hoodlums in this national, especially . those who tread on our law wearing official or quasi-official cloaks,' he said, according to the Washington Post. Rush, who represents a district on the south side of the Chicago that is 65 percent black, is no stranger to high-profile symbolic gestures. In 2004 he was arrested, along with other Congressmen, for trespassing at the Sudanese embassy during a protest of the Darfur genocide. He was a civil rights leader throughout the 1960s and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. In 2008, he warned Senators that refusing to seat Rolland Burris, who was appointed by scandal-plagued Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich, was tantamount of lynching. In 2009, he sponsored a bill that would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic rifles to register for federal firearms licenses, one of the strictest gun control proposals in recent years. Hoodies are standard attire for the . thousands of people who have marched in cities across the country . demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman. New York state senators wore hooded sweatshirts at the state legislature earlier this week as a shot of support for the protestors. The hoodie escalated as a political symbol when Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera said: 'I’ll bet you money that if he didn’t have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn’t have responded in that violent and aggressive way.' He later added to the fury by saying: 'If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word.' The comments sparked outrage and helped fuel the anger of protestors, who turned them into a symbol of support for Trayvon. Celebrity endorsements: Rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs and singer Chaka Kahn were just two of the celebrities who wore hoodies in support of Trayvon protestors . Solidarity: Maimi Heat star LeBron James tweeted this photos of he and his teammates wearing hoodies to show their support . Keeping it real? Rapper Nelly (left) poses with a simple, dark hoody. But what, exactly, is New York Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire wearing? Chaka Kahn produced a music video . with actor Boris Kodjoe called 'Fear Kills, Love Heals,' which was is a . tribute to Trayvon. It features several celebrities including Angela . Bassett, Eva Marcille, and Garcelle Beauvais wearing hoodies and singing . a remake of 'Super Life.' Miami . Heat star LeBron James tweeted a photo of himself and his teammates . wearing hoodies as a show of support for the Trayvon campaign. Zimmerman, . a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, has not been arrested for . killing the unarmed teenage February 26 in a gated community in Sanford, . Florida, because he claimed the shooting was self-defense. However, . it was revealed Tuesday that the lead homicide detective wanted to . charge Zimmerman with manslaughter in the teen's death after questioning . him for several hours at the police station. The local state attorney's office stopped the arrested, saying they didn't believe they could win a conviction because of Florida's Stand Your Ground law. Zimmerman claimed to police Trayvon punched approached him and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. He said the teen then climb on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times. Zimmerman said he feared for his life when he pulled out his Kel-Tec semi-automatic 9mm pistol, which he was licensed to carry, and shot the teen in the chest at very close range. Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday . Under state law, a gun owner can open fire if he has a reasonable fear of being killed or severely injured by an attacker. A local grand jury, a the Florida State Attorney's Office and several federal agencies are all investigating the case to see whether the killing was, indeed, lawful. The federal agencies are also looking into whether the case is a hate crime after a 911 call surfaced with Zimmerman muttering a word that was possibly a racial epithet. The information about Zimmerman's possible arrest comes as new information about Trayvon has begun to paint a different picture of the teen. School records from the Miami Herald reveal he was suspended from high school three times -- once for truancy; once after he was caught carving graffiti and a school administrator discovered he had a 'burglary tool' and bag full of women's jewelry; and a third time when he was caught with a marijuana pipe and an empty baggy with drug residue. The conservative news site the Daily Caller dug up a Twitter account that it claims belonged to Trayvon. On the site reveals a message from his cousin implying that Trayvon might have attacked a bus driver. It also makes references to doing drugs. Trayvon's family maintains none of the new information is relevant to the shooting case and that it is an attempt the smear their son's name and harm their credibility.","Acting house speaker slammed hammered the gavel and ruled Rep Bobby Rush out of order after he put the hood of his great sweatshirt over his head .

Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on Sunday after a British newspaper published a photograph of him smoking through a bong. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina, in Richland County. Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police have said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on the USC campus. ""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment,"" said Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, in a statement Sunday.  See the photo on the cover of Star magazine » . ""I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part, ""Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."" In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who have signed on to ""My Victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.","Charges will be filed if warranted, sheriff's spokesman says .

Michelle Knight was gang-raped and impregnated in junior high - a year before she suffered more than 10 years of abuse under a kidnapper, an alarming report has revealed. Michelle was the first alleged victim of Ariel Castro, abducted off a Cleveland street in 2002. She was not seen again until this past Monday, when the 32-year-old was freed from captivity along with two other women and a child. Scroll down for video . First pictures: Michelle Knight, who is now 32, is pictured as a teenager before her disappearance in 2002 . Great aunt: Deborah Knight, left, says that that three male classmates grabbed Michelle at school about a year before she was abducted and raped her . But Michelle's troubles began before the kidnapping. Her great-aunt told the New York Daily News on Thursday that three male classmates grabbed Michelle at school and raped her. Deborah Knight told the paper that if . that wasn't enough of a hardship, she later found out that she was . pregnant as a result of that attack - and later had a son she named . Joey. Concern: Michelle Knight's great-aunt Deborah Knight says that her niece had a child as a result of the junior high sex attack . The boy was placed in foster care shortly after he was born. Michelle remains hospitalized since . she, along with Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were freed the Seymour . Avenue home owned by Castro. Her twin brother Freddie told the paper that when he saw his long-lost sister, she asked him for a hug. He added: 'She was so freaking happy. I gave her a hug, but I couldn’t give her a bear hug because of all the . things that happened to her.' Relatives told the Daily News that she is looking forward to being reunited with her son, now 13, after she leaves the hospital. It was revealed earlier this week that Michelle is reportedly suffering hearing loss and facial bone damage after years of vicious beatings to her head, it has emerged. Her mother Barbara, 50, said she never gave up . hope and will . now be able to introduce Michelle to the half sister she has never met, . 10-year-old Katie, who was born after she disappeared. On Wednesday, Barbara told to the Today show about how she had never given up hope that her daughter was alive - but that she was led to believe the woman, then in her 20s, had fled. 'Certain people said she didn't want . nothing to do with me but still in my heart I thought no, because I knew . my Michelle,' she said. 'They figured she just left because of . the baby and everything. No contact: Michelle's mother Barbara, pictured, said she has not yet been reunited with her daughter . Troubled: She told Savannah Guthrie some people told her Michelle had wanted nothing to do with her . '[Police] told me if she breaks the law or they spot her, they'll let me know - but nothing happened.' Barbara, who said she filed a missing persons report after Michelle vanished and continued to search for her, said her sons have been reunited with Michelle but she has not yet seen her. 'I just wish that my daughter would reach out and let me know that she's there... She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found but thank God that somebody did,' she said. 'I don't want her to think that I forgot about her... Hopefully whatever happened between us, if something did - I hope it heals because I really want to take her back to Florida with me.' Sources told Fox 8 that Michelle appears to have facial bone damage from her horrific treatment. But Barbara said that she knew little about what had happened to Michelle since she last saw her as she has not spoken with detectives, she said. 'There was a detective who called me but he just said it was my daughter,' she said, adding that she missed his call and that he had left work when she called back. 'I didn't get a hold of anyone.' Family: Barbara Knight's 10-year-old daughter is seen outside their home in Florida before they leave for Ohio . En route to Ohio: None of the Knight family spoke to reporters before they were driven off at speed in a white car with New York license plates . Instead, she only knows the details from watching news reports. While . the stories of missing Cleveland girls Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry, who were also found on Monday, . have remained high-profile cases over the last decade, little was known . of Michelle. While . family appeals for Gina and Amanda have been frequent and . well-publicized over the past ten years, her case appears to have been . long forgotten. Michelle was in her early twenties when she . was last seen on August 23, 2002, at her cousin's house near West 106th . Street and Lorain Avenue. Mrs . Knight said she would often put up fliers around Cleveland's West Side . and even after moving away she would return to continue the search on . her own as police were little help. High-profile: The missing person cases of Amanda Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were well-known to people in Cleveland - but the disappearance of Michelle Knight drew little attention . Found: The women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday after Berry managed to escape . Barbara Knight previously told The . Plain Dealer that Michelle vanished shortly after she was scheduled for a . court appearance in the custody case of her son. The mother told the paper that she had become involved with an abusive man whom she thinks injured her toddler grandson, eventually leading Michelle to lose the boy. Michelle had him as a teenager; . her mother said that she had been assaulted at school but it was never . taken seriously by police. She then fell pregnant soon after and dropped . out of school. Michelle was never registered as missing on the Ohio Missing Persons website.

00b98ede70285565df7b273b04b8ac92de6bae71,"New York (CNN) -- Protesters will resist any efforts to remove them from the Lower Manhattan park where they have been camped for nearly a month, despite Mayor Michael Bloomberg's order that they vacate the park at 7 a.m. Friday so it can be cleaned, an organizer said Thursday. ""Come tomorrow morning, we will passively resist and make it as difficult a process to remove us as possible,"" said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Tyler Combelic. ""It's not an occupation if you can't occupy the park."" His words appeared to be backed up by the sentiment of the crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who filled Zuccotti Park Thursday night. ""All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street!"" they chanted. Combelic called the mayor's announcement a ""not-so-veiled attempt"" to force protesters from the park, setting up a possible confrontation with authorities. Protesters descended on the privately owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy. ""You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,"" said City Council Member Charles Barron. Daniel Mintz of MoveOn.Org said he was planning to deliver to Bloomberg more than 350,000 petitions and signatures he received Thursday from supporters around the nation. ""The mayor would do a lot better cleaning up Wall Street than cleaning up the plaza,"" he said. ""The park is clean,"" said Letitia James, a councilwoman from Brooklyn. ""The issue of cleanliness is a ruse, a disguise and nothing more than an excuse to end OWS."" Some protesters could be seen sweeping up debris. Others said they have used donated funds to clean the park. A number of unions have pledged to support demonstrations cropping up in cities nationwide. Maida Rosenstein, president of UAW local 2110, said members of her chapter planned to gather at the park at 7 a.m., when the cleaning is scheduled to begin. ""If the mayor thinks he's going to evict these protesters and end these protests, he needs to know that New Yorkers are watching,"" Rosenstein said. ""The unions are going to be there tomorrow and are also watching."" Bloomberg met Wednesday with protesters and told them that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about ""unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park."" ""The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,"" Deputy Mayor for Operations Cas Holloway said in a written statement. But the situation in the park is ""not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,"" he said. The cleaning is to be done in stages, and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said. ""The park has not been cleaned in four weeks, a process that is normally undertaken every night,"" Brookfield said Thursday in a statement. ""Our goal is to keep the park clean, safe, and accessible to all."" A walk in the park Thursday night found it in orderly shape. The only distinctive smell was an occasional waft of marijuana smoke. Loads of cardboard boxes holding clothes and other personal belongings were neatly tied up in one area; garbage bags were piled in garbage-collection areas; a number of people were cleaning up. Authorities have distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining a list of rules for protesters after the scheduled cleanup. The rules prohibit camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; using bicycles, skateboards or skates; and storing personal property that interferes with park use. Zuccotti Park was built for the general public, but the weeks-long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation. The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. For almost a month, demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Organizers have taken inspiration from this year's Arab Spring protests that swept through North Africa and the Middle East. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York's financial district, and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months.""

One friend even described how he had a conversation with the shooter on the morning of the attack where he acted normally. Junior Nathan Heckendorf told CNN that Fryberg had just returned to school after being suspended following a fight during football practice. Scroll down for video . Acted normally beforehand: Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the  recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting . In an interview with the station, he said: 'His final words that he said to me were about the fight. He said ""It was an act of anger, and an act of aggression and I should have used words"".' Students who knew Fryberg described him as outgoing and unlike the loner personality that is often associated with school shootings. 'He seemed totally normal,' said Gladis Jimenez, 15. 'Yes, he had a lot of friends.' Another student told CNN: 'He seemed like the perfectly normal kid we all knew, everyone knew him. He was always a very nice kid.' At The Grove Church in Marysville, hundreds of parents, students and community members overflowed aisles during a vigil on Friday evening, holding flowers and crying audibly throughout a prayer service. Outside, 9th grader Bella Panjeli said she attended a different school but was friends with one of the female victims, calling her 'a beautiful girl and so, so sweet.' She also said Fryberg was in an ongoing dispute with his cousin over the victim's affections. 'I heard he asked her out and she rebuffed him and was with his cousin,' Panjeli said, adding that she learned of the connection after talking to the victim's family and friends. It was a fight over a girl.' Reputation: A witness to the shooting said Fryberg - who was a member of the school football and wrestling team - was popular and 'always a nice guy' There were no indications on Fryberg's social media accounts that he had been planning such a rampage, and was even seen smiling while posing for a photo after his homecoming dane. But on Tuesday he posted his feelings of despondency, apparently over a romantic split, on Twitter. 'It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to,' he wrote. Photos uploaded to his Facebook profile also showed that he was a gun enthusiast and keen hunter. One of his posts on Instagram show him holding a 17HMR that he was given for his birthday. All of the victims of the shooting were under 18, and three of the wounded were in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, said Joanne Roberts, chief of medicine at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The fourth wounded victim suffered less serious injuries. Describing the deadly attack, Jordan Luton told CNN: 'He came up from behind and had a gun in his hand and he fired about eight bullets ... They were his friends so it wasn't just random. 'Then he turned and looked at me and my girlfriend ... and kind of gave us a smirk and turned around and then shot more bullets outside.' Other witnesses said he had a blank face when he walked into the room full of hundreds of students. Hobbies: Recent photos downloaded onto his Facebook page suggested he enjoyed hunting and was a gun enthusiast. He took a photo posing with a rifle he was given for his birthday .","According to classmates Jaylen Fryberg was outgoing and not a loner .

00b9fd732f0e48dc658acc01e4651cc7f5f04f2c,"(CNN) -- The king of the South Pacific nation of Tonga died ""peacefully"" Sunday at a hospital in Hong Kong, a Tongan government official said Monday. He was 63. A cause of death has not been released by the government. ""Tonga has just woken up to the sad news of the passing of King George Tupou V,"" said Paula Ma'u, an official in the Ministry of Information and Communication. ""We are all in mourning."" Ma'u said Crown Prince Tupouto'a Lavaka, heir to the throne, was with the king ""just before he passed away."" Pesi Fonua, editor of Matangi Tonga online news website, said the Oxford-educated king was known for his world travel and spending habits, but was also respected for his efforts to bring democratic reforms and modernize Tongo. ""This king brought in things like mobile phones and other advances that we couldn't dream would come to Tonga, and his push for democracy made a big impact on the people here,"" Fonua said. However, he said, Tongans had ""mixed feelings here in the community"" about the king. ""He lived a bachelor life, always a single man, and he traveled a lot around the world and spent money. He brought us in some ways forward into the 21st century, but some people have different -- not as good -- views on him."" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her condolences in a statement Monday, crediting George V with guiding ""his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a constitutional monarchy."" Tonga, with a population of 106,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006 and quickly promised to speed up government reforms demanded by the people. ""Let us rebuild a new capital and a new Tonga,"" George V said in 2006, a week after a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of Nuku'alofa led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins. In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs. Tonga is an archipelago of 171 islands directly south of Western Samoa. Less than a third of the islands are inhabited. The present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the Tongan islands were first united.

After blowing more than $5 million in his first two seasons in the NFL on things like multiple BMWs and suped-up Dodge Chargers, New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie has turned over a new leaf - he's traded the fancy Beemers for a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius and has recommitted himself to financial discipline. In an interview with Newsday, Cromartie tells reporter Bob Glauber that his days of reckless spending have come to an end and that he is 'all about saving money.' 'I was out of control,' Cromartie said. 'I remember [former Chargers teammate] Quentin Jammer used to tell me to slow down, but I couldn't do it. I just loved spending money.' Bye-bye, bling! Antonio Cromartie says he now 'all about saving money' after blowing more than $5 million during his first two seasons . For example, at one point, Cromartie had 'nine cars, two expensive homes, piles of jewelry, [gave] extravagant gifts and cash -- lots of cash -- to friends and family members who would simply ask, and shopping sprees that ran into the tens of thousands of dollars. Cromartie spent so much on so many things and so many people he can't even remember where it all went.' Of the cars - which included two Dodge Chargers, two BMWs, two Cadilacs and a 1965 Caprice - Cromartie says he spent upwards of $100,000 just to fix them up. Cromartie - who is the middle of a four-year, $32 million contract with the Jets - has now recruited the help of a financial adviser, who credits the transformation to showing the 29-year-old athlete what it's like to have a 'settled' home life. Proud papa: Cromartie with his wife and two of his 12 children . 'I can tell a lot of things to a lot of clients, but that doesn't mean they'll listen and accept what I say and practice that discipline,' Cromartie's adviser Jonathan Schwartz said. '[Cromartie] buys into it. He knows that a professional athlete's earning period is limited, and that the best form of accumulating wealth is not to spend. His peers will go buy Rolls Royces and Ferraris and diamond jewelry, but 25 years from now, Antonio can still maintain his lifestyle, sit at the beach enjoying a cocktail and say, ""I've earned it.'"" Cromartie, who has 12 children with eight different women in six different states, says he wants to be a role-model for younger players who might be tempted to make the same mistakes he made as a young athlete with a lot of money. 'I tell the young guys, ""'Don't spend any money the first year and a half of your career,'"" Cromartie said. 'You don't know what will happen after that. You might be released. You might be hurt. Just save your money.' Filthy rich: Antonio Cromartie currently is in the middle of a 4-year, $32 million contract with the New York Jets .","Antonio Cromartie is now 'all about saving money'

00ba519cf87a2d49dfb48fadf2af0112dc0e4947,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, has withdrawn his name from consideration as surgeon general of the United States, he said Thursday. Dr. Sanjay Gupta will continue his work as a surgeon and for CNN. ""This is more about my family and my surgical career,"" Gupta told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The neurosurgeon said he would likely have had to give up practicing had he taken the job as the nation's top doctor. In addition, the 39-year-old and his wife are expecting their third daughter any time, and the government job would have meant long periods away from his family, he said. ""I think, for me, it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else,"" he said. ""I just didn't feel I should do that now.""  Watch Gupta explain his reasoning » . Gupta said he had not been formally nominated for the job, though he had spoken with senior members of the Obama administration, who made it clear he was their choice, he said. ""I think there was a real melding there,"" he said, adding that he felt flattered to have been considered. Earlier Thursday, an administration official said Gupta ""was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general. He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family. We know he will continue to serve and educate the public through his work with media and in the medical arena."" Sources said in January that Gupta had met then-President-elect Obama in Chicago, Illinois, in November to discuss the post. At the time, Gupta declined to comment. The transition team was impressed with the combination of Gupta's government experience, as a White House fellow in 1997 and a special adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, along with his medical career as a neurosurgeon and his communication skills, the transition sources said. Gupta is a member of the staff and faculty of the Department of Neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He regularly performs surgery at Emory University Hospital and at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he serves as associate chief of neurosurgery. Gupta joined CNN in 2001. As chief medical correspondent for the health and medical unit, he is a lead reporter on breaking medical news, provides regular health and medical updates for ""American Morning,"" anchors the half-hour weekend medical affairs program ""House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta"" and reports for CNN documentaries. Based in Atlanta, Gupta also contributes health stories to CNN.com, co-hosts ""Accent Health"" for Turner Private Networks, provides medical segments for the syndicated version of ""ER"" on TNT and writes a column for Time magazine. He also anchors the global health program ""Vital Signs"" for CNN International and is featured in a weekly podcast on health issues called ""Paging Dr. Gupta."" Just after joining CNN, Gupta became part of the team covering the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Later that year, he led breaking news reporting on a series of anthrax attacks. In 2003, Gupta reported from Iraq and Kuwait as an embedded correspondent with the U.S. Navy's medical unit -- and worked alongside them, performing brain surgery five times. In addition, Gupta reported from Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the tsunami that swept the region in December 2004. He also helped cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005.

00bad06b94b77274e6f7e33e2a84e473f938cdac,"Billie Jean King understands that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and that is how she is taking the advent of the International Premier Tennis League in Asia. The American legend was not just an inspirational driving force behind the growth of women's tennis, but also the playing of the sport in the team format, having first founded the concept with her own league in the mid seventies. On Sunday night she was bringing her Mylan World Team Tennis event to London's Royal Albert Hall, at a time when players joining up under the banner of a group outfit is suddenly all the rage. VIDEO Scroll down to see Billie Jean King speak about the Elton John Aids Foundation . BIllie Jean King and Tim Henman share a joke before the Mylan WTT Smash Hits event . King says she is flattered by the International Premier Tennis League copying her competition's format . Her opposing captain in the charity event was Sir Elton John, who actually penned his classic Philadelphia Freedom song in 1975 as a favour to her, providing a theme tune for one of her professional tennis teams. King has looked at the four-team league currently going in Asia, and might be excused for envying the nouveaux riches of the format, given the eyewatering sums they are paying the players taking part. Roger Federer is reliably said to be collecting at least £2.5 million for his two appearances in India while Andy Murray's fee for representing the Manila Mavericks in three matches is believed to be around £1m. Even the veterans taking part, such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, are reckoned to be pocketing well in excess of £500,000. Jamie Murray, Kim Clisters, Henman and Sabine Lisicki pose with King (centre) on Sunday . Sir Elton John (left) and John McEnroe (right) are involved in the event which takes place at the Albert Hall . Before the London event - featuring the likes of John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis – King spoke of her delight that her longstanding concept appears to be proliferating. It does not trouble her that her own version in America, which takes place after Wimbledon, cannot afford to attract the world's top players in the way that the IPTL has done. 'I'm thrilled, it's a form of flattery,' she said. 'We are celebrating our fortieth year next summer. This is fantastic. It's really important to support tennis, whatever the level. The IPTL is taking professional tennis to new cities with great players. 'I have always been in favour of the team format, always thought that children signing up to tennis should be in a team, they like to be with their friends. Team sports are the biggest in the world, that was my background originally and that of my brother, who played Major League Baseball.' In a sport where players are often resistant to any form of innovation, those participating in Asia and the Middle East have clearly been enjoying themselves and embracing the concept (as they ought to with its rewards). Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis will be among the stars of the game involved in King's tournament . It is a lively product and television-friendly, fitting in to modern tastes, with players showing their personality. It is certainly hooking people in a way that is making the worthy week-in, week-out event the WTA and ATP Tours look very samey by comparison. What nobody in the game is quite sure is how the IPTL is making its sums add up, and how it will go forward after what looks already to have been a successful first year purely in terms of the product. But then in light of the deep pockets of some of the franchise owners they might not have to balance the books in the same way that more regular events do. McEnroe is also a supporter of the team concept: 'You've got to remember that in the seventies team tennis was packing out stadiums, with players like Jimmy (Connors) and Bjorn (Borg) taking part,' he said on Sunday afternoon. McEnroe, Hingis, Sir Elton and Roddick pose with  Heather Watson at the pre-tournament press conference . 'I think the key is this having its own time slot. Maybe the game changer part of this is that the schedule is a bit less year-round than it was. It's got a bit more chance of being a success.' The least that the IPTL is going to do is fuel the current debate in tennis, traditionally resistant to change, about how it needs to broaden its appeal to cater more for modern demands. Sir Elton, who for twenty years has captained his team in charity matches against that of King, is also a keen advocate of the team format despite his enthusiasm for the game's traditions. His sporting loves are football and tennis and, as he pointed out, he goes back a long way with both. He joked 'I'm so old I can even remember (Jaroslav) Drobny beating (Ken) Rosewall at Wimbledon in 1954.'","Billie Jean King has long been a promoter of team events .

""The University of Houston community is saddened to learn of the tragic death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time,"" the university said in a statement released today. Houston woman Ana Trujillo, 44, was arrested after police found her boyfriend with multiple stab wounds to the head . Her boyfriend was found lying on the floor. She is now being held on $100,000 bond . According to authorities, police were called to the Parklane Building - a luxury condominium building popular amongst professors at the nearby university - in the 1,700 block of Herman Drive in Houston's Theater District about 4 a.m. Sunday in response to an assault in progress. When police got to the 18th floor condo, Trujillo opened the door and let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a hallway between the entryway and the kitchen. Authorities say he was stabbed multiple times, each time, apparently, with a stiletto shoe. Trujillo was the only one present when the body was discovered. Crime scene: authorities say a Houston woman stabbed a man to death with a stiletto heel at this condominium complex . Houston police tell ABC13 that Trujillo initially was cooperative with detectives, but later stopped talking as she was taken to a precinct for additional questioning. Investigators say Trujillo doesn't live in the building and appears to have just been visiting. Hotel staff told authorities she appears to have arrived last night.

The Pope is in Asia, having begun his trip just days ago with a stop in Sri Lanka, for a week-long tour, and has already caused a huge spike in interest when it comes to travel in the region. Flight searches to Sri Lanka have increased by 19 per cent, while the numbers for the Philippines have increased by a whopping 51 per cent week on week from last year. Pope Francis has just arrived in the Philippines - and already travel searches for the region have spiked . The Pope's six-day Asian tour includes stops in Manila, where adoring crowds waited, and Sri Lanka . Interest in Manila has seen a particular increase, up 60 per cent already, according to Cheapflights.co.uk . Cheapflights.co.uk spokesperson Oonah Shiel attributes this 'halo effect' to the Pope's genuine mass appeal. Of particular interest to travellers is Manila, where His Holiness is expected to deliver a huge open air mass on Sunday, January 18, to over 5 million attendees. 'Searches regarding the Filipino capital are up 60 per cent and counting,' she said. Week on week from last year, searches for the Philippines have increased by 51%. Pictured: Palawan . When His Holiness arrived at the Manila airport, Filipino children performed in his honour . Following his stop in Sri Lanka, where the Pope canonised its first saint, travel interest has gone up by 19% . 'As well as driving short-term interest in flights to the region, the Pope's visit is expected to raise awareness of the plight of the more marginalised groups in the area and provide a longer-term boost to ethical tourism,' Shiel added. In fact, Pope Francis has already canonised Sri Lanka's first saint, after calling for unity in the conflict-hit nation. 'Every step he makes, every car ride he takes, every moment he stays with us is precious for us,' said Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. 'Seeing him pass by is a grace.'","Flight searches for the Philippines up over 50% week on week from 2014 .

The sketch was drawn  during a hospital bed interview with KCEN-TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford, 35, who is recovering after being shot in the stomach and shoulder. The suspect, who managed to escape the scene in Bruceville-Eddy on foot on Wednesday morning, is described as a white male, 30 to 35 years old, with a medium build and a receding hairline. 'We are actively looking for [the suspect],' Trooper D.L. Wilson of the Texas Department of Public Safety told ABC News. 'We had troopers out overnight, but we didn't get any calls of suspicious people. We can't rule out that he's not in the area, but more than likely, he's left the area.' Scroll down for video . Suspect: KCEN weatherman Patrick Crawford (left) helped police put together this sketch (right) of the man who shot him as he left the TV studio on Wednesday morning. He said he had never seen him before . Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN, was shot after he climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday. An unknown man approached him in the parking lot and they exchanged words. The weatherman managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911. Doctors at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple said that Crawford was recovering and in fair condition after surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. From his hospital bed, he spoke to investigators and told them he had never seen the man before. Police have not yet found a motive for the shooting. Gunned down: Footage shows Crawford, 35, being stretchered away after he was shot on Wednesday . Attack: The man continued to shoot at Crawford as he drove away and flagged down help nearby . Hit: The weatherman sustained gunshot wounds to the stomach and shoulder, and a bullet grazed his head . KCEN also reported that police were at the station on Thursday, checking IDs of everyone driving in the parking lot. Crawford's wife, fellow KCEN meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, also revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life. 'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night. 'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.' Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page. Heroic: Crawford's wife Heather said police believe he saved his life by driving off and flagging down help . Attack: Crawford is pictured left with his fellow KCEN hosts on Wednesday - just hours before he was shot . Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012. He  married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year. The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday. 'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN. 'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting. 'The shooter, as of this note, has not been caught. We do not know who the shooter was or if he is connected in any way to KCEN or its employees.'

00bc0db28043d0d0fdedce94a6a1bc41835a9326,"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Defence minister Anna Soubry said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces . The army was today ordered to end the booze-fuelled culture of ‘drinking to the point of oblivion’. Defence minister Anna Soubry said binge-drinking in the forces could not be justified as just a form of ‘comraderie’ or ‘letting down of the hair’. She was challenged by a committee of MPs about cheap alcohol on offer to troops, where a triple gin and tonic can cost as little as £1. The forces have long had a drinking culture, with officers viewing it as part of the bonding process between recruits and a way to relive stress from serving on the frontline. But Ms Soubry, a former health minister, said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces, and called for less binge-drinking by serving personnel. It follows high profile cases of debauchery, inappropriate behaviour and allegations of sexual assault fuelled by alcohol. Last week Army recruit Gavin Hope, 22, was fined £300 by the RSPCA for swallowing his pet goldfish as part of the NekNomination drinking game. He filmed himself drinking a pint glass of beer, spirits, a raw egg and some fish food, before downing a glass of water containing the unfortunate fish. The video was uploaded to his Facebook page along with the comment: ‘Not a proper man unless you drink fish.’ Today Ms Soubry insisted was not a ‘killjoy’ and recognised from her time as a barrister that people with stressful jobs needed to let their hair down. But she said the ‘vast amounts’ consumed by the armed forces were unacceptable and must be scaled back. ‘I am not convinced that we couldn't do more about the culture of drinking in our armed forces,’ she said during a hearing of the defence select committee. ‘I'm not some killjoy. But sometimes there has been an attitude in the past that it was acceptable, as part of that de-stressing process, to all go out and consume vast amounts of alcohol as part of that camaraderie and that letting down of the hair. ‘There is nothing wrong with some of that, but the levels of drinking to the point of oblivion and all the rest of it is a culture which I don't welcome in any workforce. ‘The incidence of binge drinking, the quantities of alcohol, across society are beginning to diminish. I would hope that would be the same in the armed forces.’ Swallowed: Gavin Hope and the goldfish Neknomination which lead to him to being brought before Gateshead magistrates court . Ms Soubry suggested that her determination to act had been strengthened by the death of a serving member of the armed forces. ‘I read the coroner's report recently into a very sad suicide case of a serving person. There were many things in that report that concerned me. ‘One of them, quite clearly, the culture of heavy drinking,’ she said. A guide for senior commander on how to deal with alcohol is to be overhauled in the light of research into alcohol abuse in the armed forces which is due to be published soon. But she acknowledged that a cultural shift could not be encouraged purely by rules and regulations. ‘You can't just put out edicts to change a culture,’ she said. ‘You can have all the most wonderful guides and manuals in the world but what's most important is the implementation of them and that is something that I am looking at, I can assure you of that.’ Labour MP Madeleine Moon said ending the ‘high level of subsidy’ enjoyed at military bars would contribute to curbing consumption. She said she got the ‘fright of my life’ when she was charged only GBP1 for a triple gin and tonic while visiting forces in the Falkland Islands two years ago. ‘One thing that could be done about alcohol problems in the armed forces is tackling the high level of subsidy in bars in military units - perhaps so they were the same price you would pay in town.’","Anna Soubry calls for an end to binge-drinking in the armed forces .

00bcc69870cdffe5e108a7be95754c3476bf9082,"Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- Skydiver Felix Baumgartner is aiming to pull off a record-breaking free-fall jump from the edge of space Tuesday, wearing nothing but a space suit, a helmet and a parachute. His goal is not only to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet, more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier, without the aid of anything besides the space suit. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. ""I'm not nuts,"" Baumgartner said when CNN first interviewed him about the project in 2010. ""You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge."" 'Human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight . But on a more serious note, he added, ""Of course I'm afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level. You know, I'm living a good life. I think the most important thing I'm doing is to come back alive."" After years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor Red Bull, the jump is scheduled for Tuesday morning at dawn. Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent, in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon. Then he will climb out of his capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched ""delta"" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, before deploying a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth. The attempt has serious risks. He and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous ""horizontal spin."" And at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit. And if he loses consciousness during the five-minute plunge, he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically. Another unknown: the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier. While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe that there will be little effect on Baumgartner, because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air, shock waves are barely transmitted. Baumgartner is an Austrian helicopter pilot and former soldier who has BASE jumped from landmarks like the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. He has been preparing for five years -- both physically and mentally. ""You have to remember all the procedures,"" he said in an interview during testing for the jump. ""You know you're in a really hostile environment. And you cannot think about anything else. You have to be focused. Otherwise, you're gonna die."" The balloon, over 500 feet tall at launch, is light and translucent. The material is only .0008 of an inch thick, and it will change shape and size as it rises. The pressurized helmet and suit, which restrict Baumgartner's mobility and weigh 100 pounds, have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt. Baumgartner was not doing interviews on the eve of the jump, but his performance coach Andy Walshe on Sunday described him as mentally well-prepared. ""He knows that he's rehearsed it and knows what to do,"" he said. ""We want him in the right state of mind. We ask him to reflect on what he's done, what he's been through and what he's achieving for himself personally, so he can relax and focus."" The record is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission. On this attempt, 52 years later, Kittinger is a consultant and mentor. He has also been giving Baumgartner advice on what to expect. For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: ""There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."" But Kittinger rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that Baumgartner is poised to beat his record. ""Oh no. I'm delighted,"" he told CNN recently. ""He's advancing science, and he'll do a great job.""","Felix Baumgartner will have only a space suit, helmet and parachute for 120,000-foot jump .

00be40289d0aea65afd2da6431db8a9fc8efc9c0,"New York (CNN) -- In the spirit of spring rebirth, the Occupy movement is ramping up activities as warm weather blankets the country. But while the season is typified by a reawakening of life outdoors, demonstrators are using sleep to get their points across. They call it ""sleepful protest."" The sleeping bags started appearing on the corner of Wall and Broad streets across from the New York Stock Exchange on April 9. A civil rights attorney sympathetic to the Occupy movement provided the legal justification for the move in the form of a court ruling from 2000. A federal district court judge said people can sleep on sidewalks as a form of political expression as long as they take up no more than half of the sidewalk and don't block any doors. Occupy organizers declared a month ago that the movement would be planning a comeback in the spring and summer. Some city and state governments, armed with new ordinances aimed at the Occupy movements, are ready to prevent demonstrators from re-establishing encampments. For the past few nights, dozens of Occupy Wall Street protesters have slept on a patch of concrete a stone's throw away from the traders and stock brokers who are the targets of their message. ""The goal here is to not violate the law and not give the police a reason to move the group,"" said Ted Schulman, who has taken part in Occupy demonstrations for several months. Every morning, they talk about income inequality and the role of big money in politics as commuters pass by on their way to jobs in the Financial District. Most people who work in the area seem indifferent. ""They just don't understand how things work,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial. ""They have fantasy ideas. But, they're entitled to their opinions."" While police have occasionally forced the protesters to move so the sidewalk could be cleaned, and a few have been arrested, Occupy protester Lauren DiGioia is not deterred. ""We're not afraid anymore. I mean, we've been through so much. All of us have been to jail,"" said DiGioia, a 27-year-old with hair dyed neon blue. ""We know we're doing the right thing."" What are Occupiers really fighting for? So-called sleepful protests have popped up elsewhere in the country with varying degrees of success. In Washington, police have been less accommodating, while in Los Angeles, protesters have taken to sleeping outside Bank of America branches, a frequent target of the Occupy movement. Similar sidewalk sleep-ins are taking place in Boston and Atlanta. The protesters on Wall Street don't expect their sleep-in to grow into an encampment like the one that became home to hundreds of people at nearby Zuccotti Park. ""I view this as the pre-campaign. I certainly doubt that this will still be here May 1st when the big rallies start,"" Schulman said. ""My guess is by that point, they'll have taken control of this space again."" Occupy organizers are calling for large-scale demonstrations across the country on May 1 in conjunction with the labor movement's International Workers Day.","The Occupy Wall Street movement is ramping up its activities .

Diehard Orioles fan Mike Soukup was driving southbound on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Monday afternoon when he saw the accident and decided to pull over and help.

'I turned to high five the guy for a good job done getting this truck up, and I thought to myself, ""Man, that looks like Chris Davis,""' Soukup told The Baltimore Sun. Davis received a 25-game suspension on Friday for a second failed drug test for an amphetamine that he later revealed was Adderall.

00c2a214ffb5790f4c2c7915ebaa973b38e854e7,"By . Lizzie Parry . A fit and healthy PE teacher lives under the dark cloud of her skin cancer returning, having suffered four bouts of the disease - despite never using a sunbed. Becky Giddins' melanoma relapsed three times since she was first diagnosed in April 2007. The 32-year-old suffered her fourth relapse in January, just a week after returning from her honeymoon. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed. Becky Giddins has survived four bouts of skin cancer, despite using sunbeds. Today the 32-year-old is raising money and awareness to help others fighting the disease. She was first diagnosed with melanoma when in April 2007 . Since being diagnosed Mrs Giddins, 32, has had a lumpectomy, half of her left lung and her lymph glands removed . Reliving her diagnosis, she said: 'When they told me it was cancer I didn’t know how to react - I was on my own and it really didn’t sink in. 'It only hit me when the doctors told me the mole was cancerous and it had be removed. 'I was completely shocked, but relieved that they had removed it. 'I have never been on a sunbed in my life - not even to build up a base tan before going on holiday. 'As part of my job and coaching I’m outside a lot but, because I’m naturally fairly skinned, I’ve always worn sunscreen.' The skin cancer was first discovered after a weird mole on Mrs Giddins’ calf changed colour and became scabby. On visiting the doctor, a biopsy confirmed the growth was cancerous which meant the mole was removed along with a surrounding 2cm of skin. Following the operation, the teacher from Kidderminster in the West Midlands, lived cancer free for almost five years. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed . In that time she met her future husband, Kevin. Over Christmas in 2011 - one week before her final CT scan to check whether she was in remission - Mrs Giddins found a lump in her groin. After a biopsy showed the melanoma had returned and spread to her lymph nodes, both were removed in February 2012 and a drain was fitted in her leg to remove lymph fluid. Mrs Giddins said: 'The second time round I kept scaring myself looking things up on the internet and making myself quite upset. 'Having the drain attached was horrible - I was permanently carrying this bag round me which was collection the fluid. 'I refused to let it get me down though, so when me and the girls went out for my 30th birthday I bought an over the shoulder bag to cover it up.' Despite her cancer and the treatment she was undergoing Mrs Giddins continued to coach and play netball. After the drain was removed, she said she felt her freedom return. She was positive, hearing from surgeons that the area was now clear from cancer. Her latest treatment to have a lump on her breast and part of her lung removed took place six weeks before her wedding to Kevin, in August last year . Mrs Giddins returned to her job at a secondary school in Kidderminster, and she and her husband returned to their normal lives. On Christmas Day 2012 - three years after getting together - 32-year-old Mr Giddins proposed and the couple started planning their wedding for August 2013. But, as preparations intensified and the hunt for wedding dresses continued, the couple received the devastating news following a routine CT scan, that the cancer had spread to her lung. Six weeks before her big day, Mrs Giddins had a third of her left lung removed and a lumpectomy on her right breast, throwing the wedding into jeopardy. Melanoma is a rare cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of the disease is a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but is most often found on the back, legs, arms and face. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and are more than one colour. They also tend to be larger than normal moles and can be itchy or bleed. Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is not known what causes the cancer, but it is thought exposure to UV light from natural or artifical souces may be partly responsible. There are around 13,000 new cases diagnosed in the uK every year. Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34 and is also responsible for most skin cancer deaths. More than 2,000 people a year die in the UK as a result of melanoma. Source: NHS Choices . She said: 'After the operation I didn’t know whether I would be able to walk down the aisle, but the thought of marrying the love of my life really pulled me through. 'When me and Kevin got together I didn’t class myself as a cancer patient as the mole had been gone for two years. 'When it returned though, Kevin was a rock for me - along with my family - and I just wanted to marry him and celebrate our relationship no matter what.' Despite tying the knot in August 2013, their dream honeymoon had to be postponed as Becky could not fly for at least eight weeks post-surgery. Finally, on Christmas Day the pair jetted off to Las Vegas to celebrate their nuptials in style. There Mrs Giddins developed a pain in her side, and in spite of initially passing it off as a urine infection she felt a nagging that it was something more serious. But two days after returning home, doctors confirmed the melanoma had spread to her liver and urethra. She said: 'I don’t like complaining but it just feels like me and Kevin can’t enjoy anything together. 'I’m now on Dabrasenib and Trametinib to try and cure me, but if they don’t work there’s currently only one last set of drugs we can try. 'I’m well aware I’m a bit of a ticking time bomb, but I just want to live a normal life, do a bit of travelling and keep playing netball.' The teacher is working to raise awareness of skin cancer, starting a fund, to which £2,500 has already been donated, for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Charity's Skin Cancer Fund. Along with his brother Ian, cousin and five close friends, Mr Giddins will climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland in July.

RSPCA inspectors found a dog starved to death in a garden shed which had been jammed shut with a breeze block. The terrier was discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, a father-of-four, who later admitted three counts of animal cruelty. The 37-year-old, of Tipton, West Midlands, told inspectors the terrier called Molly had gone missing days before the discovery on March 16. Wollam, an unemployed foundry worker, told them he had no idea how she ended up starving to death in the barricaded shed. As he was sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday, he was told the case was one of the worst magistrates had seen. However, Wollam avoided prison because he is the sole carer of his four children after his ex-partner walked out on the family, the court heard. Banning him from keeping animals for life, the chair of the bench told the panel: 'This is a very serious offence, one of the worst that has come before this court. 'It is only because of your early guilty plea and domestic commitments you are not going to prison.' They gave him an 18-week suspended sentence and placed him under supervision for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and pay £300 costs. Gaynor Sutton, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said an inspector visited Wollam's address on March 16 after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours. They were told the dog had been bought from Wollam. When the inspector was let into his home by one of his children, an emaciated Bichon Frise dog was found to be around half its expected body weight. One of the dogs found at the Tipton home of Paul Wollam. The 37-year-old avoided prison after admitting three counts of animal cruelty . But the most grisly discovery was made when the breeze block was moved away from the shed door and the dead terrier was discovered. Mrs Sutton said: 'The inspector saw the Shih Tzu in the garden and the dead terrier type dog in the shed. 'There was a breeze block in front of the door. 'The defendant arrived home and was shown the dead dog. He said he thought it had gone missing and that he had seen it a few days before. 'The dog had matted hair and there was no food or water in the shed. An inspector visited Wollam's address after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours . 'The dog had been dead for some time and there were maggots in the coat. 'A post mortem found an emaciated dog with hardly any body weight and the cause of death was assessed to be starvation. There were no broken bones.' In a statement, the vet who carried out the post mortem said: 'The care of this dog was appalling, allowing a dog to die of starvation is despicable. A terrier type dog found dead in Wollam's shed which was jammed shut with a breeze block . 'Death would have been slow and prolonged. 'There is a complete lack of care and compassion. This was death in the worst way imaginable.' Ravi Dev, defending, said: 'He tells me he looked through the garden and in the streets but couldn't locate the dog. 'He did not realise it was in the shed.' Mr Dev went on to say Wollam, who had been made redundant from his foundry job, had suffered a period of depression after being left alone to care for his four children. 'He was not coping properly,' he said. 'It's no excuse for what's happened and he takes responsibility for that.'","Terrier discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, 37, of West Midlands .

Last week’s emergency surveillance legislation may have sounded like something out of George Orwell’s novel 1984, but was cited as yet another real-life example of states trying to control their citizens. It’s been 65 years since Orwell described a fictional dystopian world of surveillance and manipulation by so-called Big Brother, and experts claim over the next decade this fiction is about to become fact. The Net Threats report from Pew Research Centre details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services all trying to control our behaviours. Scroll down for video . More than 1,400 experts were surveyed for The Net Threats report by the Pew Research Centre. The report details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services (stock image pictured) This could mean what we buy, read, watch and share will be restricted, and our surfing history stored for future use. More than 1,400 experts, including analysts, editors and professors, were canvassed for their opinion. The Pew Centre report discovered four major threats facing the web: . Actions by nation-states to maintain . security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and . segmentation of the internet. Trust . will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and . corporate surveillance - and will likely increase surveillance in the . future. Commercial . pressures and influences will affect the flow of information, and make . the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear . following debates about internet fast lanes. Efforts to fix the TMI (too much information) problem might over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing. According to their responses, they believe actions by nation-states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and segmentation of the internet. Trust will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and corporate surveillance - and this will likely increase surveillance in the future. And commercial pressures will affect the flow of information, and make the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear following debates over internet fast lanes. Paul Saffo, managing director at Discern Analytics and consulting associate professor at Stanford University, said that by 2025 'the pressures to balkanise the global internet will continue and create new uncertainties. 'Governments will become more skilled at blocking access to unwelcome sites.’ Dave Burstein, editor of Fast Net News, added: ‘Governments worldwide are looking for more power over the net, especially within their own countries. ‘Britain, for example, has just determined that ISPs block sites the government considers ‘terrorist’ or otherwise dangerous. In 1984, Winston Smith is told to control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak (still from the 1984 Michael Radford film adaption is pictured). Experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea, and predict that, by 2025, it will become more common place, and spread across the west too . 'This will grow. There will usually be ways to circumvent the obstruction, but most people won’t bother.’ The main criticism of such plans, and the main issue surrounding the data obtained, is its impact on privacy. Raymond Plzak, from The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, said: ‘The inconsistent protection of privacy, whether private information is voluntarily provided or not, as well as the inconsistent protection against exploitation will continue to be the bane of connected environment.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) has condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, in what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion' He continued that if local, regional, national and international private and public sector companies fail to join forces and accept a universal way of handling these privacy issues, sharing data and being connected will become more limited by 2025. This will also have an impact on preventing content being shared around the world. In 1984, character Winston Smith is told to edit reports and control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak, and experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea. And they predict that, by 2025, this will become more common place, and widespread across the West too. ‘The increased Balkanisation of the internet is a possible outcome of the [Edward] Snowden revelations, as people seek to develop systems that are less accessible by the NSA, GCHQ and so on,’ said Professor Kate Crawford, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Civic Media. ‘Meanwhile, the dominant content companies may seek ever more rigorous ways to prevent the flow of copyright content within and across borders.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden recently condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, voicing concerns about the lack of public debate, fear-mongering and what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion'. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. The controversial 'fast lane' rules received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix for example, could pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies, such as Netflix (pictured), for faster delivery of their traffic to users. The Pew report said such commercialisation of the internet is the biggest challenge to its growth by 2025 . At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment.

Although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. Experts, including Glenn Edens, director of research in networking, security, and distributed systems at PARC said: ‘Network operators’ desire to monetise their assets to the detriment of progress represents the biggest potential problem.' A post-doctoral researcher, who was not named in the report, continued: ‘We are seeing an increase in walled gardens created by giants like Facebook and Apple. 'Commercialisation of the internet, paradoxically, is the biggest challenge to the growth of the Internet. Communication networks’ lobbying against net neutrality is the biggest example of this.’ Earlier today, the Internet . Association wrote to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that broadband providers could turn the internet into 'a . pay-for-priority platform more closely resembling cable television than . today's onternet.' The . group, which represents Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and others, urged the Commission to protect its open and neutral . architecture, which is the force behind the internet's success. PJ Rey, a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Maryland, added that by 2025: ‘It is very possible we will see the principle of net neutrality undermined. ‘In a political paradigm where money equals political speech so much hinges on how much ISPs and content providers are willing and able to spend on defending their competing interests. 'Unfortunately, the interests of everyday users count for very little.’ While a former chair of an IETF working group concluded : 'Corporate influence on the political process will largely eliminate the public’s freedom to do as they please on the internet. 'I would like to see the internet come to be regarded as a public utility, as broadcast spectrum was, but I think the concentration of power is too extreme for that degree of freedom to happen.'","More than 1,400 experts, including analysts and professors were surveyed .

00c59c2992fecbda9a3b172b46bff6ccb03f935c,"SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuters) -- Chile called home its ambassador in Peru on Monday, as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the South American neighbors. They have bickered over the rich Pacific coast fishing waters for years, and Peru published a new map on Sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border. Chile's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in Peru, Cristian Barros, for consultations. ""We feel that this type of publication (map) and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the Peruvian government,"" spokesman Ricardo Lagos Weber said on Monday. ""Chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over Chilean territory,"" he said. Peruvian President Alan Garcia said in June his country would take Chile to the International Court at The Hague to resolve the case. Peru's foreign minister, Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, sought to downplay the row. ""It is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called (back to report),"" he said. ""The channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open, and the countries must work toward a positive agenda,"" Garcia Belaunde said. The sea border, set in the 1950s, starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters. Its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the Pacific Ocean. Analysts say Peru will have its day in court and the Hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved, unless something happens to escalate the debate. ""The only thing that could happen, which would be very worrisome, would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty (in those waters) now that Peru officially claims them. That would be a shame,"" said Ricardo Israel, a political analyst in Chile. Chile defeated Peru in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor. The two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky. The dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco, a grape liquor. Peru and Chile are the world's top producers of fish meal, a cattle feed, and fishing is one of the engines of Peru's economy. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Battling out of his seat, Benjamin Levy's ribs hurt so much he thought they were broken, but what struck him most about seconds after Asiana Flight 214 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of San Francisco airport was the silence. None of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken Boeing 777, no one from the cockpit announced anything - and now previously unseen pictures taken by Levy in the confused aftermath have been released by the Associated Press. Ignoring his pain, Levy, 39, rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed - losing its entire tail section. Escape: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214, many with their luggage, wait on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at San Francisco International Airport . 'We were left on our own,' said Mr. Levy to the New York Times. 'There was no message from the pilot, from the crew - there was no one.' Levy ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door, despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane. The wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach - making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway. Deciding not to exit the Boeing 777 through that exit, Levy, who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer, moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be. Survivor: Ben Levy speaks about being aboard Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6th, 2013, at San Francisco International Airport, during an interview at his office in San Francisco, on Tuesday, July 9th, 2013 . Ben Levy, (right), poses for photographs with his wife Sumi Lee Levy, as he wears a yellow ribbon put on by a firefighter on the tarmac for triage after Asiana Flight 214 crashed on Saturday . He moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat - forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt. 'She couldn't move,' said Levy to the New York Times. 'There were two other guys. We couldn't pick her up.' A firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered Levy and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane, which had now burst into flames. 'People were pushing each other out. There was a lot of commotion. We got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out. I'm so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly.' Having landed at San Francisco many times before, Levy told NBC Bay Area that he knew the approach was wrong. Fiery Wreck: The flight crashed upon landing, and two of the 291 passengers aboard were killed . Collecting Their Thoughts: The passengers of Asiana Flight 214 hug each other after having survived the terrifying crash on Saturday . As has transpired, this was pilot Lee Kang-kooks first landing at San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft, despite being an experienced Boeing 747 pilot. 'When he realized that, he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late,' Levy recalled in a phone interview with NBC Bay Area. 'So we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again. And then we landed again pretty hard. 'It felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely. He tried to correct, which probably helped. We would have hit the rocks.' As the plane's belly skidded along the runway, Levy described the sheer terror inside. 'It was surreal,' Levy said. 'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.' Taken to San Francisco General Hospital, Levy was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family. 'I am in pain, but not too bad compared to other people,' he said, adding on Twitter of his actions, 'Just did what anyone in my position would have done.' Help: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the San Francisco International Airport . Despite Levy's assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found, the bravery of cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye, the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised. Another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped. Lee herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety, despite suffering a broken tailbone that she didn't know she had until she was finally treated at San Francisco hospital later. While it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of Asiana Flight 214 survived, it is 'most likely' that one of the the two Chinese teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane. While a fire department spokeswoman said this on Monday, authorities are not saying if it was Ye Meng Yuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, who suffered the tragic accident. Head Count: The survivors of Asiana Flight 214 gather together on the tarmac of San Francisco International Airport after evacuating the Boeing 777 which crashed on landing on Saturday . 'The incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles,' Mindy Talmadge, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg. 'Most likely it was a fire vehicle, but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete.'

00cb03ed4ee4f0b4fb5467e5cbbab6eb28c773b8,"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has again indefinitely blocked plans to disseminate video of an important federal court case involving same-sex marriage in California. The justices in an unsigned order Wednesday prevented any distribution of the live video stream outside the San Francisco, California, courthouse where the case is being heard, and any real-time or delayed posting on the Internet. In a trial that began Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco will decide whether the state's Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage is constitutional. California voters approved the measure in November 2008, prompting an appeal by several homosexual couples. As part of a pilot program, the judge had agreed to allow video of the trial to be sent live to other rooms within the courthouse and to five other federal courthouses, and to be posted several hours later on the popular video site YouTube.com. Opponents of same-sex marriage had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, saying witness testimony could be affected if cameras were present. It is extremely rare for a federal trial to be televised to the broader public. The Supreme Court's latest order allows distribution only to designated ""overflow"" rooms in the San Francisco courthouse, where people who want to view the trial but are unable to fit into the courtroom can watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television. A majority of Supreme Court justices concluded expanded broadcast should not permitted because, they wrote, ""It appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting."" There has been much internal debate in federal courts around the country about the televised experiment, with several judges and administrators privately expressing concern that it could eventually lead to the entire judiciary being televised, including the Supreme Court. In dissent to the ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer and three liberal colleagues complained the public would be deprived of watching ""a nonjury civil case of great public interest to five other federal courthouses located in Seattle [Washington], Pasadena [California], Portland [Oregon], San Francisco [California], and Brooklyn [New York]."" He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens and Sonia Sotomayor. Breyer said the Supreme Court traditionally has stayed out of what he called another court's administrative discretion on such matters, saying, ""I believe this court should adhere to its institutional competence, its historical practice, and its governing precedent -- all of which counsel against the issuance of this stay."" The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (09A648).","Lower court had OK'd posting videos of trial on Internet .

The family of Tyler Clementi will allow Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, to use his name in the proposed federal legislation, to be known as the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act,"" an attorney for the family said. Clementi's body was recovered from the Hudson River in September, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge. The bridge spans the river between New York and New Jersey, which is home to Rutgers. Clementi jumped from the bridge after two other Rutgers students allegedly videotaped a sexual encounter between him and another man and streamed it online. The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" Lautenberg said last month. The legislation also classifies cyber-bullying as a form of harassment. Lautenberg said that federal funding would be provided to colleges and universities to deal with harassment and bullying against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. ""The family appreciates the courtesy extended to them during the drafting of the bill, and hopes that the legislation, if enacted, will improve the well-being and safety of America's college students,"" the family's statement said. ""The Clementi family is humbled and gratified that the loss of their son, however painful for them, has inspired nationwide discussion and awareness of the need for a renewal of values of respect for human dignity and personal privacy, particularly for young people in this time of rapidly evolving technology."" Dharun Ravi, 18, who was Clementi's roommate, and Molly Wei, 18, have been charged with invasion of privacy.

A Coronation Street actress who is seen in the soap taking a cocktail of drugs to kill herself after being diagnosed with a terminal illness has said that assisted suicide should be legalised. Julie Hesmondhalgh, 43, plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from incurable pancreatic cancer and decides to end her life to stop the pain. Viewers will see her drink a cocktail of drugs before dying in the arms of her weeping husband Roy, who did not want her to give up her fight against the illness. Scroll down for video . Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, seen here playing Hayley Cropper alongside her husband, Roy, in Coronation Street, has spoken out in favour of legalising assisted suicide . Hayley, who has been in the programme since 1998, will use a cocktail of drugs to kill herself . The controversial episode will be aired on ITV next week after a series of high-profile so called right to die cases have gone before the courts. Locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson asked the courts for permission to end his own life with a doctor's help. The 58-year-old was left paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak after having a major stroke. Unlike Julie Hesmondhalgh's on-screen character, he was unable to commit suicide unassisted because of his disabilities. He died from ill health last year after the High Court ruled doctors could not help him kill himself - although his case will still go before the Supreme Court so they can rule on the issue. Mrs Hesmondhalgh – a member of the Humanist . Association, which supports assisted suicides – said she could not . imagine how anyone dealing with such an illness in either themselves or a . family member could be against the right to die. Emotional scenes: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, silently looks out of the flat window holding her husband Roy Cropper's hand before she takes her own life in a controversial episode of Coronation Street to be aired next week . She said: ‘I would like to see it . legalised, very much so. But I have to put the caveat that it has to be . properly done; you have to make sure that people don’t go around killing . elderly people, say, just for the inheritance. ‘But I can’t imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson case and see his suffering and be against it,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It’s quite a simple thing for me – and I understand it isn’t for everybody – but we need to look at this issue seriously.' Official guidance was published which said people who help loved ones end their lives may escape prosecution even if they benefit financially from the death. Cancer battle: Viewers have seen Hayley Cropper (right) struggling to get out of bed as she battles with pancreatic cancer . The rules, set out by the Director for Public Prosecutions, make clear that anyone acting out of 'compassion' is unlikely to face court action. Mrs Hesmondhalgh said there was an ‘almost holy atmosphere’ as she filmed her controversial last scene. The star, who joined Coronation Street in 1998 to play the soap’s first transsexual, won the hearts of viewers with her on-screen romance with cafe owner Roy. Away from the screen, she is married to writer and actor Ian Kershaw, taking time off in 2001 to give birth to her daughter Martha Mo. She has now decided to leave for good to concentrate on theatre roles. Right to die: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, is seen ending her own life in the controversial episode of Coronation Street which is due to air next week . The star's character, who is suffering from incurable cancer, will kill herself in Monday's episode . She told Radio Times that the scenes were not ‘beautiful’ and were ‘necessarily agonising, because of her steely determination to end her own life’. But she added that the storyline was ‘timely and appropriate’ and that ‘there are no easy answers’. ‘This is a conversation that needs to be had,’ she said. The . actress also said she had no problem being written out in such dramatic . fashion. ‘It would have been more convenient for me as an actor if I . could have come back later on if work wasn’t working out for me, but it . would have been a complete betrayal of everything that we’ve done . because they [Hayley and Roy] are the most steadfast and loyal and . loving couple... they just would not have separated for any other reason . apart from death.’ Keiran . Roberts, Coronation Street’s executive producer, said: ‘We’re not an . issue-based show but sometimes a story will highlight an issue and this . is such a case. ‘Pancreatic cancer is an illness . that people may not know a lot about and the right-to-die issue will . spark a debate, I’m sure, and that’s right and proper.’ The . storyline will reflect the split in opinion in the right-to-die debate . with Roy and Hayley’s friend Fiz Stape struggling to deal with Hayley’s . decision. The actress said: 'I can't imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson (right) case [the paralysed stroke victim who lost a case in 2012 to end his life by assisted suicide] and see his  suffering and be against it' Coronation Street producer Stuart Blackburn said: ‘This is a very sensitive issue and we will be exploring the effects of her decision on husband Roy who has a huge emotional and moral dilemma over her choice to die this way. ‘Not everyone will feel Hayley’s decision is the right one and we fully respect this. ‘For that reason we will be exploring both sides of the debate on screen.’ The Samaritans have warned that the storyline could create copycat suicides among vulnerable viewers. The on-screen controversy comes as a YouGov survey found almost three quarters of those questioned supported a change to existing laws regarding assisted suicide.","Julie Hesmondhalgh plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from cancer .

00cdede32ff010099a4e8c8288d1f494458cb941,"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman failed to identify himself twice during a confrontation with Trayvon Martin and missed opportunities to defuse the situation that led to the death of the teen, a detective says in a newly released report. Zimmerman, who served as a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of Martin, 17, in Sanford, Florida. The report is part of information Florida prosecutors released Tuesday. It includes a previously undisclosed portion of a video of Zimmerman showing injuries he said he suffered in the altercation with Martin. Zimmerman, 28, told police he shot the teenager in self-defense and has pleaded not guilty. But Martin's family and civil rights activists have said Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, racially profiled Martin and ignored a 911 dispatcher's advice not to follow him. Among the documents released was a report from an officer who conducted computerized voice stress analysis tests on Zimmerman. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . ""Mr. Zimmerman was subjected to two exams, and was found to be classified as No Deception Indicated,"" the report said. Also released Tuesday was an unredacted capias request, a request that someone be taken into custody, prepared by the lead police investigator in the case, Christopher Serino. ""Investigative findings show that (Zimmerman) had at least two opportunities to speak with (Martin) in order to defuse the circumstances surrounding their encounter,"" Serino wrote in the report. ""On at least two occasions (Zimmerman) failed to identify himself as a concerned resident or a neighborhood watch volunteer."" The detective also said Zimmerman's actions ""are inconsistent with those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject."" In the same report, Serino wrote that Zimmerman's injuries were ""marginally consistent with a life-threatening violent episode as described by him."" Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, filed a motion Wednesday asking that his client be allowed to appear at a Friday bond hearing in ""civilian clothing instead of a prison uniform and without restraints."" Video and photos of Zimmerman shackled and wearing jail garb could prejudice prospective jurors, O'Mara said. In response to the document release, O'Mara said Tuesday it will be up to a judge and jury to interpret what Serino's report means to the case. ""I don't want to get into a battle with investigator Serino's report considering what he believed after it seems he made the decision that charges should be filed,"" he said. ""His suggestion that it's marginally consistent, again, is up for review. Those people will have to look at it, whether it'd be Judge (Kenneth) Lester in a motion hearing where the jury will also make that determination, whether or not those injuries give rise to a reasonable belief in George's mind that he was a victim of great bodily injury or potential death."" Martin's family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said he agrees with the detective's assertion. ""The lead detective made the determination at least on two different occasions Zimmerman had opportunity to defuse the situation. When he got out the car, he could have at least said, 'I'm a neighborhood watch volunteer' to defuse the situation and it's likely Trayvon Martin would be living today,"" Crump said. George Zimmerman: Trayvon Martin threatened my life . Also released Tuesday was a previously undisclosed portion of a video re-enactment of the incident that police taped a day after the shooting. In the video, Zimmerman, bandages on his head, talks about how his wife is treating his injuries. ""I have a broken nose. She says I could use stitches, but she'd rather not put them in -- as long as I didn't mess with my head. My skin is already healing nicely,"" Zimmerman said. Also Tuesday, the Sanford Police Department announced that Serino had ""voluntarily"" asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer. Sanford Sgt. David Morgenstern said the change is not a demotion and he said he did not know why Serino requested the move. Crump said the move was clearly a demotion. ""The lead detective today got demoted and that's one of those things we have to question. He told what he thought was the truth,"" Crump said. Zimmerman had been released on bond after his arrest. But he was ordered back to jail this month after a Florida judge revoked his bail, citing about $150,000 in donations in an account controlled by Zimmerman that he had not disclosed at the April 20 bond hearing. O'Mara is asking Lester, a Seminole County Circuit Court judge, to set a bond similar to the $150,000 bond initially granted Zimmerman, arguing that he poses no danger to the community, is not a flight risk, and ""cooperated fully"" with police before his arrest.

A Lothario lorry driver who wooed two women with marriage proposals then stole their life savings has been jailed for 20 months. Derek McMaster, 64, got engaged to both victims - one a kidney patient on dialysis - then plundered their bank accounts leaving them 'permanently scarred'. These women only realised they were being two-timed as they plucked up courage to give evidence during his trial at Warrington Crown Court in Cheshire. Divorcee Jean Antrobus thought she had found the perfect gentleman, who behaved like an ‘angel’, buying her flowers every week and taking her away for romantic trips by the sea. But all the time he was stealing her money. Victim: Divorcee Jean Antrobus, pictured left, was one of the two women targeted by conman Derek McMaster, right, who was jailed for 20 months for his scam . McMaster of Falcon Hey, Liverpool, exploited his victims through lonely heart adverts in local newspapers and posed as a police officer, putting on a uniform and pretending to go to work. He changed his plea to guilty minutes before a jury was about to be sworn in. Recorder Andrew Long said: 'This case involved the deliberate exploitation by you, of two vulnerable women. 'It's clear both women have been scarred, I suspect permanently. 'You then gave self-pitying excuses for what you had done.' Prosecuting, Andrew Green described how McMaster first targeted kidney dialysis patient Margaret Dickinson. The 64-year-old has renal failure, Chron's disease and chronic arthritis. The 'perfect gentleman' moved in and became her carer, gaining trust to use her bank card and steal £3,150 between March and June last year. Elaborate: Warrington Crown Court (pictured) found that McMaster's victims did not know they were being two-timed until they arrived to give evidence . McMaster then moved on to Runcorn mum-of-two Jean Antrobus, aged 64, who the court heard desperately wanted 'a companion to stop feeling so alone'.. She 'trusted him immediately', with McMaster claiming to be a semi-retired Merseyside Police officer, and even leaving the house in uniform. The fraudster asked her to marry him, then used her bank card to steal £5,275. He used the cash to pay for a ring, meals out and holidays to Rhyl. His deceit was uncovered when his victim attempted to pay for plastic surgery but found her card was over its limit. She needed counselling as a result and now feels 'so guilty over my own stupidity'. The former shop worker said earlier this month: ‘I had been married for 38 years. I’d never answered a lonely . hearts advert in my  life before, but I was feeling a bit fed up so I . decided to ring the number. ‘He was an angel at first, he bought me bouquets of flowers every week and took me away for weekends, a real gentleman. ‘He . said, “Let’s get married. I never loved anyone like you”. He was . convincing and I loved him, but now I realise I was paying for it all . along.’ Last June the . couple held  a big engagement party, but  by that time McMaster had . already been stealing from her on a regular basis. ‘He said he was a . retired police officer and worked part time,’ she added. ‘He . had a full uniform and handcuffs and used to come home with tales of . how he had arrested drug users, but now I know he had simply bought the . outfit over the internet.’ She said: 'It was terrible because I had got to love him. 'I've had to have anti-depressants to get through it. 'He's a rotter, a horrible man. I don't want him to break someone else's heart.'","Derek McMaster jailed for 20 months after stealing £6,500 from them in elaborate scam .

00ce620aadad194da337e972749dba7d602da206,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A recent college graduate is suing her alma mater for $72,000 -- the full cost of her tuition and then some -- because she cannot find a job. Trina Thompson has sued her alma mater, Monroe College of New York. Trina Thompson, 27, of the Bronx, graduated from New York's Monroe College in April with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology. On July 24, she filed suit against the college in Bronx Supreme Court, alleging that Monroe's ""Office of Career Advancement did not help me with a full-time job placement. I am also suing them because of the stress I have been going through."" The college responded that it offers job-search support to all its students. In her complaint, Thompson says she seeks $70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three-month job search. As Thompson sees it, any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials, which include a 2.7 grade-point average and a solid attendance record. But Monroe's career-services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment, she claims. ""They're supposed to say, 'I got this student, her attendance is good, her GPA is all right -- can you interview this person?' They're not doing that,"" she said. Thompson said she has fulfilled her end of the job-search bargain, peppering companies listed on Monroe's e-recruiting site with cover letters, résumés and phone calls. But no more than two employers have responded to her outreach, and those leads have borne no fruit. Her complaint adds, ""The office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their Monroe e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement. They have not tried hard enough to help me."" She suggested that Monroe's Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades. ""They favor more toward students that got a 4.0. They help them more out with the job placement,"" she said. iReport.com: ""Don't sue your alma mater"" Monroe College released a statement saying that ""while it is clear that no college, especially in this economy, can guarantee employment, Monroe College remains committed to working with all its students, including Ms. Thompson, who graduated only three months ago, to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search."" Thompson says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she cannot afford one. When she filed her complaint, she also filed a ""poor person order,"" which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit. Asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters, Thompson said yes. ""It doesn't make any sense: They went to school for four years, and then they come out working at McDonald's and Payless. That's not what they planned.""

Speaking after his win, Mr Whyte said: 'It was an amazing once in a lifetime experience. The scenery is out of this world.' The marathon runner had only been back from injury for one week before taking on the mammoth challenge. He suffered a stress fracture in his hip after the 100km World Championships in Doha in November last year. This was brought on by his osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. The competitors and crew slept in tents (pictured) on Union Glacier and some runners prepared by training on treadmills in industrial freezers . The father-of-two, who suffers from bone condition osteoporosis, said he was close to losing his fingers to frostbite during the gruelling race . In 2012 Keith won the British and Irish Championships, along with ultra-marathons in Dingle and Longford, Ireland. As a result of his victories, he was  ranked number one for fifty miles in Europe and number two in the world. Despite his experience, he admitted before the race: 'I don't know how you can prepare for something like this because it will be minus 30, minus 34 degrees,' he admitted before the race. 'It will be running on snow and then wearing so many layers, when I'd be just used to wearing shorts and a singlet.' Runners have been known to prepare for the freezing temperatures by running on treadmills in giant industrial freezers. Advice on the website for the race said: 'Having some prior experience of running on ice / snow terrain in temperatures of -25C with your polar clothing would obviously be advantageous, but probably not practical for people who live in more temperate climates. 'As a result, some competitors have come up with innovative means of preparing for the race. These methodologies have ranged from running on beach sand to running on treadmills in freezers.'

00d0cef3aa2f1e6204896380413263a32a2407a9,"A report said had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Rigby’s murder could have been avoided . The family of Lee Rigby today accused Facebook of failing to help stop his killers as it emerged the social network has still not handed over data from five accounts opened by one of his extremist murderers. His sister Sara said the internet giant had ‘blood on its hands’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier’s murderers and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier.’ However, the social network’s staff failed to tell MI5 about the ‘graphic and emotive’ posts from Michael Adebowale, made just six months before the atrocity took place. Incredibly, Facebook had already disabled seven of his accounts – five of which were flagged over links to extremism – without informing security services. The damning report by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee released yesterday also revealed that Adebowale had 11 Facebook accounts but GCHQ has still only been given the contents of six. It said in 'over a year since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, GCHQ has not received all the information requested. Having not seen the content of the other five accounts, GCHQ cannot be certain that there is no evidence of attack planning in the rest of these accounts'. But civil liberties campaigners fear Drummer Rigby's appalling murder is being used as 'an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population'. And former MI6 director Richard Barratt said today it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for businesses like Facebook to hand over  terror related activity to the security services. He told the Today programme: 'I think it's unfair to ask companies to make that decision. I think there has to be a legal basis for them so they know what they are to do and what not do to'. Barrett added it was 'almost impossible' because of 'legalities' and because there are 125million posts a day on Facebook passing on terror-related posts would be an 'enormous job'. Fusilier Rigby’s sister, Sara McClure, 25, said: ‘Facebook have my brother’s blood on their hands. I hold them partly responsible for Lee’s murder. 'I suppose it has given me someone to blame but I’m not sure that’s what I wanted. Knowing it could have been prevented and it wasn’t prevented. I blame the failings of MI5 and the internet companies. Mainly the internet companies’ Twisted: Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale. Facebook hosted exchanges between Adebowale and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier’ Michael Adebolajo shows a bloodied hand and knives following the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich on May 22, 2013 . Response: Former MI6 director Richard Barratt said it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for  Facebook to hand over terror related activity but David Cameron claims: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this' In a long-awaited report, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee yesterday said that had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Fusilier Rigby’s murder could have been avoided. And in a damning indictment of US-based tech firms, it said the same mistakes could have been made by websites run by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Twitter or Microsoft, which have become a ‘haven’ for terrorists. Lee Rigby's step-father Ian said: ‘We are left with questions. The report doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. It has brought back memories - A lot of the feelings are back and it doesn’t give the correct information as to the reason the delays happened. ‘The companies’ duty of care to its customers is to use information like that if necessary when the discover it'. David Cameron said the internet companies – once frequently courted by his government – were being ‘used to plot murder and mayhem’, adding: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this ... we expect them to live up to it.’ The murdered soldier's family said today that the Prime Minister is the only person with the answers they need. Ian Rigby said: 'He's the only one who has the full report and probably the only one who could get the answers that we want'. Heartbroken: The family of Lee Rigby, pictured after the trial of his killers, blame the security services and particularly internet companies like Facebook for not preventing his death . Files: Michael Adebolajo's profile compiled by secret services detailing his movements and associates in the years before he murdered Drummer Rigby . Background: Adebowale had fewer convictions than Adebolajo but it was his interest in extremist material and posts on Facebook that has sparked debate over whether social networks should have told MI5 and MI6 . The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said today: ‘Any meeting they ask for they will get.’ Talking about the affect his brutal murder had on his family he said: ‘When we are together as a family we laugh about memories of Lee. But we all have difficulty  talking about the murder and what has happened since. We are a normal family drawn into this situation. ‘We have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn Lee. 'The loss of Lee will never go away. You learn to live with it over time, but it's still with you over time. Former home secretary Jack Straw said there was a ‘cultural problem amongst the leadership of some of these [sites] who have got a distorted libertarian ideology, who believe that somehow this allows them to be wholly detached from responsibility’. Miss McClure told The Sun newspaper: ‘It is totally clear from this report that information so vital could have alerted our security services to this terror plot.’ The ISC criticised both MI5 and MI6 for a string of blunders when tracking Fusilier Rigby’s killers, Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo – but, controversially, it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time, they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder. This is despite the fact that: . An application for intrusive surveillance on Adebowale in 2013 took ‘nearly twice as long as it should have’ amid internal wrangling by MI5. Home Secretary Theresa May signed the warrant only after Fusilier Rigby was dead. However, the ISC’s 191-page report also highlights an exchange on Facebook between Adebowale and a fanatic since codenamed FOXTROT. Adebowale expressed his desire to murder a soldier in retaliation for UK military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was advised on different methods of murder. Announcing £130million in funding to help the fight against ‘self-starting’ terrorists, the Prime Minister declared: ‘We must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the authorities or the internet companies themselves. Their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem.’ But Isabella Sankey of Liberty said: ‘The ISC shamefully spins the facts, seeking to blame [websites] for not doing the agencies’ work for them.’ Executive director Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: 'To pass the blame to internet companies is to use Fusilier Rigby’s murder to make cheap political points. 'The committee should not use the appalling murder of Fusilier Rigby as an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population,' he said. A senior internet industry source told the Independent there has been a 'coordinated' attempt by the security services 'to attack US-based technology companies in particular'. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear – we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.’","Facebook has failed to give GCHQ 5 of Michael Adebowale's 11 accounts .

00d10c9be83b619a4b8f9127d86ad7a4d15b3b09,"By . Sam Webb . 'Quiet, calm and gentle': Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, 25, was stabbed to death as he made his final pizza delivery. He was due to start his career as an IT consultant . A pizza delivery driver about to start a new career was stabbed through the heart by two thugs trying to steal his mobile phone, a court heard. University graduate Thavisha Lakindu Peiris was stabbed repeatedly in his car as he made the final delivery of his shift on October 27 last year. 'Quiet, calm and gentle' Mr Peiris - who had been persuaded to carry out a final delivery before clocking off - had moved from Sri Lanka in November 2011 to study economic engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. He was about to start a new career in IT technology before he was stabbed to death in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, a jury was told. Shamraze Khan, 26, appeared at Sheffield Crown Court today charged with his murder, while Kasim Ahmed, 18, has already pleaded guilty to the charge. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said it was a ‘joint enterprise’ motivated by robbery. 'The prosecution submit that the defendant Shamraze Khan and another man, Kasim Ahmed, were jointly responsible for the murder of Thavisha Peiris,' he said. He added: 'Thavisha was chosen as a target for robbery by Khan and Ahmed, just as they had selected the couple only an hour or so beforehand. 'The mobile phone had clearly been their target.' The prosecutor told the jury: 'By October last year that Mr Peiris was due to start work in the field of information technology. 'He was never able to use his studies to . his advantage to take up work in his chosen sphere, or to return to Sri . Lanka, because he was stabbed to death.' Kasim Ahmed, who has already pleaded guilty to the murder charge . Loss: Sri Lankan-born murder victim Thavisha Lakindu Peiris (right) with his father Sarath Mahinda Peiris (second left) and mother Sudarma Narangoda (second right) The student had been working at a branch of Domino's Pizza in Sheffield and was delivering an order to an address in Southey. When he failed to deliver the order, his workmates set off to find him . The jury heard that barely an hour before the pair left Thavisha in a pool of blood at the wheel of his car as they attempted to rob his mobile phone, they had already robbed a young couple in Sheffield city centre. Both Ahmed and Khan accept being responsible for that knifepoint robbery in which mobile phones were also stolen. Mr Smith said: 'Regardless of which defendant was actually responsible for inflicting the fatal stab wound [on Thavisha], they were both jointly involved in the attack and each is guilty of the offence of murder.' Grief: Sarath Peiris (left), 66, and Vajira Narangoda Peiris, 59, parents of Thavisha Lakindu Peris, who was stabbed to death during a pizza delivery in Sheffield . Crime scene: The street where Mr Peiris was stabbed to death while delivering pizzas . The court heard the pizza delivery driver had pulled up to deliver an order when he was fatally attacked. His phone was found in his car - where it had been yanked from its windscreen holder. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been stabbed once in his neck and three times in his chest - puncturing his heart. Mr Smith QC told jurors two gloves with Mr Peiris’ blood on were found in Khan’s home - while Khan’s palm print was also found on the roof of Thavisha’s car. Thavisha asked his manager at Domino¿s Pizza if he could go home because he was tired, the court heard. But his manager asked Thavisha if he would take one more order . 'Khan and Ahmed had planned to commit offences of robbery and about an hour or so before the attack, they had jointly committed an offence of robbery involving two young people at Castle Market, in Sheffield. 'During this offence Ahmed had produced a knife and injured one of the two people in question. 'After the robbery the defendants returned to the home of Khan, where they were both living, but they went out again and decided to rob Thavisha while he was trying to deliver a pizza.' The court heard that the vicitm had worked until 7am on the morning of his death, and had returned to start another shift later that evening. Mr Smith said that at 8.40pm, Mr Peiris asked his manager at Domino’s Pizza if he could go home because he was tired. But his manager asked if he would take one more order, which was to the Southey Green part of Sheffield as well as one other order. He left the pizza outlet at 9.50pm, the court heard. Mr Smith said that, while nobody actually witnessed the attack, an eyewitness saw two men in hoods stood around his car, looking in the driver’s window shortly before the attack. Other eyewitnesses saw two men running away from the murder scene in the direction of Khan’s flat, the court heard. One resident described the pair running at a 'hell of a pace', the jury heard. 'The prosecution contend that these were the defendants,' said Mr Smith. Mr Peiris' dead body was eventually discovered by a colleague. 'He opened the passenger door and touched Thavisha’s arm, but he didn’t move,' said Mr Smith. 'At that point he noticed there was blood on Thavisha’s shirt and blood in the car.' Paramedics were called but Thavisha died at hospital, the court heard. Speaking about the pathologists’ findings, Mr Smith said: 'There was a stab wound in the left side of the neck which had passed through Thavisha’s spine. 'In the central area of the chest, there was another wound which had penetrated the heart.' The court also heard that there were stab wounds to his ribs, as well as superficial stab wounds to his face and hands. Following the killing both defendants went to the home of Ahmed’s father, and alluded to family members that something serious had happened - but did not reveal what it was, the court heard. Three days later, Ahmed was discovered by police in a storage area in his girlfriend’s house and Khan discovered hiding in the loft of his parents’ house. Ahmed has already admitted two counts of robbery, which Khan also admits. The trial continues.

Melanie Simmonds, 31, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was on a cheap holiday with her boyfriend Jay Buckley in Kefalonia, Greece, when they decided to hire the vehicle instead of taking a taxi. But the former care worker said that while she was in the driving seat the wheels locked and she was unable to steer, leaving them hurtling down the cliff, stopping short of the water's edge. Melanie Simmonds, pictured with her then boyfriend Jay Buckley, on the quad bike which they later crashed . She frantically rung the last number in her phone which went through to the driving school and one of the instructors - Peter Tovey - was able to rush to their side. Miss Simmonds said: 'I'd been wearing cropped jeans and underneath my bones jutted through bloodied flesh on my left knee, right shin and ankle. 'The diving instructor was with us in minutes using his flip flops as splints on my shattered bones. 'When the ambulance arrived I was put on a stretcher and winched slowly up the cliff face. It took 30 minutes and felt like I was screaming forever.' Miss Simmonds in hospital after the incident in which she suffered a broken nose and hand a multiple fractures to her legs . Plaster casts were put on her legs in a Greek hospital soon after she crashed off a 60ft cliff on the quad bike . Miss Simmonds had suffered multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and fractured nose in the accident, which happened in June 2010. Mr Buckley, who she has since split from, sustained only minor injuries. The crash was not deemed anyone's fault but the couple were not covered for quad biking in their insurance. She explained: 'Taxis were so expensive so I suggested we hire a quad bike to get back. They were so cheap to hire for the day. 'We'd seen other people do it and they looked fine. We both strapped on our helmets. I was in the driving seat with Jay holding on to my hips. 'I was enjoying the scenery of the stunning coastal road with a steep drop down with sheer cliffs on one side. The crash happened in Kefalonia, Greece, in June 2010 during a cheap holiday break for the care worker . Miss Simmonds during a dive on the trip. The last number she had called was the driving school so when she crashed she called them and an instructor was sent to rescue her and her ex-boyfriend Jay Buckley . The diving instructor took off his flip-flops and made a makeshift splint to support her leg until emergency services could arrive and airlift her to hospital . 'But as we drove along, I spotted a sharp corner up ahead. I turned the handlebars into it. But as I tried to turn out again, the wheels seemed to lock. 'I was helpless as we plummeted off the cliff. If I hadn't been wearing my big camera bag on my back I think I would have been paralysed or worse, as it protected my back. 'The next thing I knew I was lying at the bottom of the cliff on the shore, with the bike in the sea and water lapping at my arm - if I'd landed a yard away I would have drowned.' She was told that Greek doctors could only do the minimum to help and they pulled her bones back together and gave her painkillers. After 10 days she was allowed to leave but needed to remain stretchered. Miss Simmonds said: 'Getting back to the UK was a nightmare. I had to spend 16 hours in an ambulance and we reserved nine seats on the plane back.' The return trip took two days and cost £8,000, which was 26 times more than the £300 trip initially cost them. Her nose was split in two in the incident and she underwent a number of operations to fix it. Pictured after her second surgery . Miss Simmonds was left in a wheelchair (right) for six months and had to have her leg put in a brace (left) A doctor told her she will never regain full strength in her legs again. Pictured right, Miss Simmonds getting ready to dive while on the holiday that left her in hospital . She had to have a metal rod through the whole bone in a second operation, which left her right leg bruised . After landing at Heathrow airport, Miss Simmonds was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey. She said: 'Family rushed to see me and I'd never been more pleased to see them. Doctors found I had multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and a broken nose. 'I needed a metal rod in my right leg, a plate in my left knee and another in my nose. The doctors there were absolutely brilliant. 'I was just so grateful. I've never appreciated the NHS so much.' After 11 days in hospital, she was allowed home but still needed seven operations.

Doctors said I'd never regain full strength in my legs. I could walk but not run long distances. 'People told me I was lucky to be alive, but it didn't feel like it. I left my job and spent my days at home feeling low.' A year after the accident, Miss Simmonds started working with The Halow Project, a local charity for young, disabled people and now has a new partner Craig Ifaia, 31. Miss Simmonds said: 'Looking back, I wouldn't change what happened. I believe everything happens for a reason. Without it, I wouldn't be who I am today. 'I wouldn't have a job I love, or be confident that I can take on anything.

00d48bf5089a093edf12ef5f3836780e97be6be0,"(CNN) -- These days, no fashion house portfolio is complete without a hotel -- or at the very least, a luxuriously designed suite. Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld are the latest fashion icons to try their hands at hoteling, with Hilfiger recently purchasing Miami's The Raleigh Hotel and Lagerfeld set to open his first branded property in Macau (albeit not until 2017). They join the ranks of many of the fashion industry's most iconic members, including Bulgari, Armani, Versace, and -- until recently -- Missoni (the Hotel Missoni brand, alas, is calling it quits). ""From a designer's perspective, a hotel gives you complete latitude to bring their way of thinking to everything, from the draperies to the textures and colors, that's what you sign up for,"" says Nikhil Bhalla, vice president of equity research in lodging at FBR Capital Markets. In many cases, a hotel acts as a sort of large-scale designer showroom. Armani Hotels, for instance, are outfitted with furnishings from Armani Home, ball gowns accentuate the décor at Milan's Maison Moschino, and no suite at Bulgari Hotel is complete without the brand's signature silver. ""Hotels are a great way to showcase the design identity of a brand, and to project a lifestyle that goes beyond products,"" notes Silvio Ursini, the executive vice president of Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Or, as Bhalla puts it, ""the handbag experience has extended itself into a lifestyle experience."" Hotel brands are just as eager to align themselves with a fashion brand (even if they don't hand over the reins completely). When they're not tapping big-name designers to decorate their suites, hotels are conjuring up fashion-led experiences to entice customers, be it a Burberry trench coat-loan program or same-day delivery from Net-a-Porter. ""For the consumer, who probably already likes the brand, these experiences are an opportunity to experience it at a higher level; it helps them bond with brand a little bit more than they would have before,"" explains Bhalla. It also offers the customers a consistency that they might not otherwise expect from a hotel room. ""When a woman comes to us for a dress, she knows she's going to look gorgeous and glamorous -- that's what we do. When she stays in our suite, she'll know the same design levels went into making the space,"" notes James Mischka, half of the design label Badgley Mischka, which designed a 1,700-square foot suite at The Breakers Palm Beach. Branding a hotel suite with a fashion label also helps it attain an extra level of exclusivity. Bulgari Hotels, for instance, mimics the exclusivity of its design brand by limiting its room count. ""There's always a scarcity value attached to these types of offerings, and at no point does a brand want to dilute that,"" explains Bhalla.","Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld are the latest fashion icons to turn hotelier .

00d4b35f860ceb2b8b9af2202841da09e8b8f058,"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:41 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:07 EST, 12 December 2013 . A 'spoilt, jealous mummy's boy' who throttled his model girlfriend before his parents tried to cover it up smashed his victim's head against a table in the 24 hours before he murdered her, it was revealed today. Newly released CCTV shows the moment controlling Elliot Turner, 20, attacked Emily Longley, 17, in a packed Bournemouth bar on the night before he strangled her. In a fit of rage the killer is then seen flinging a glass across the room while Emily's friends console her on the evening before she was choked to death in his bedroom. A new documentary, to be broadcast tonight, also contains the 999 call his mother made 40 minutes after Emily was found dead, which was a devious attempt to conceal her son's crime. Killer: 'Brash, flash, spoilt' ex-public schoolboy Elliot Turner, 20, choked Emily Longley in his room at his parents' home and then used his parents to cover it up . Anita Turner, 51, tried to claim that Miss Longley, may have been choked by a tight necklace, but in fact her child had gone 'absolutely nuts' and killed her in his bedroom. His father Leigh destroyed a letter his son wrote confessing to the crime. Turner's friends have spoken of his paranoia before he killed his girlfriend in May 2011, after a month where he became increasingly paranoid that she was seeing other men. On 'Mummy's Little Murderer' due to be broadcast on Channel Five tonight, Turner is shown as a maniac intent on killing her. Emily's father Mark told The Sun: 'It is horrifying to think someone put their arm around our daughter's neck and literally choked the life out of her. 'To think someone could put their hands on Emily, who would never hurt anyone, and do such a violent act to her, was awful.' Cover up: Leigh and Anita Turner helped to hide evidence that Emily had been murdered and were also jailed last year for protecting their spoilt son . The murderer had enjoyed a privileged life where his parents denied him nothing. Turner had been educated at a £12,000 private school, and as an adult would carry up to £1,000 cash on him to 'show off'. He also spent nights out in Bournemouth bars with his friends, who he called 'The Firm', drinking champagne and trying to seduce women. His parents were so wealthy they even paid £30,000 to send him to the Priory for rehab after he became addicted to cocaine and alcohol. After spending huge sums impressing women he met Emily, and considered her a 'trophy', his murder trial heard. But the model received admiring glances from other men and Turner could not cope, sending him spiralling into fits of rage. During their four-month relationship it later emerged he had bullied and physically abused her, before threatening to kill . her and other men who knew her in a series of texts and emails. In one note written by Emily to him said: 'I love you but don't say you'll kill me. You make me scared'. CCTV also reveals on one occasion he took a hammer into a nightclub to threaten another man he believed was attracted to his girlfriend. Guilty: Elliot Turner (left) strangled Miss Emily (right) in his bedroom during a drunken argument . Love note: A letter from Emily Longley to Turner said: 'I love you' but 'don't say you'll kill me' After he killed her Turner claimed that Emily had died in her sleep and his parents backed him up. A post-mortem was inconclusive and the 20-year-old was not charged. But police were suspicious and bugged his house, and his parents were heard discussing the conspiracy. Elliot said he 'lost it' that night and his mother said: 'We've done the right thing'. His father then said: 'Stop denying it. He f****** strangled her'. He was then arrested and Turner then claimed during the trial he acted . in self-defence when Emily attacked him and he grabbed her by the . throat for five or six seconds and he then woke up to find her dead in . his bed. Pictured together: Elliot Turner and Emily Longley, pictured in the days before her death. Behind the scenes he was controlling and abusing her . Bereft: Emily's parents Caroline and Mark. Caroline said  that Turner saw Emily as 'a trophy adorned on his arm' and were distraught that she tried to hide it from them . But the jury did not believe him and he was jailed for 20 years in May 2012. His arrogance was such that even . his own defence lawyer was forced to describe him as ‘brash, flash, . boastful, spoilt, volatile, obsessive, possessive and obsessed’. He will . serve a minimum of 16 years. His parents Leigh, 56, and Anita, 53, were jailed for 27 months, and were both released in September.

Paul Hill, 43, from Stockton-on-Tees was burned after an alcohol-based body steriliser burst into flames while he was under general anaesthetic in an operating theatre at Stockton’s University Hospital of North Tees. The father-of-four is now awaiting answers from an internal investigation by hospital bosses into how the incident happened. Paul Hill, 43, has been left scarred for life after his stomach caught fire during an operation . It was only after his operation that Mr Hill was told the shocking news that his stomach had caught fire when a solution used to clean the skin ignited. He said: 'I didn’t even know it was possible. When they told me I didn’t know what to think. 'I had only just come around and told my wife what had happened. She didn’t believe me - thinking it was the drugs.' His wife Tracy, 42, added: 'He said to me ""I have been set on fire”. He was high on morphine so I didn’t believe him at first. 'But a nurse in the room said he was being serious. It was scary.' The operation during which the blaze happened came during a long-running battle with ill health. During the operation, some alcohol-based body steriliser caught fire and burned his stomach . Stockton's University Hospital of North Tees is now investigating how the accident happened . Mr Hill was diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis in November 2012. The inherited condition causes numerous polyps to form, mainly in the large intestine. These can develop into colon cancer if untreated. As a result, Mr Hill underwent surgery to remove part of his digestive system. A side effect of this is that hernias can develop and he had to have an operation on a hernia in February this year. Mr Hill said: 'I didn't even know it was possible. When they told me I didn't know what to think' But problems persisted and he went into hospital again on March 19, which is when the operating room fire occurred. The experience has also worried the couple's son McKenzie. The 11-year-old has been diagnosed with the same condition as his father and may face similar surgery in the future. 'He has seen me go through it all - all the surgeries and now this,' said Mr Hill, a clerical assistant at Morrisons. Mr Hill said: 'I just hope they learn from what happened to me cause it could have been fatal to someone else' The ordeal has left Mr Hill with scars on the right side of his stomach. He also requires a district nurse every day to change his bandages. 'I just think what more can you take,' said Mrs Hill. 'You get through one thing, then there is something else.' Mr Hill added: 'I just hope they learn from what has happened to me because it could have been fatal. A spokesperson for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We take incidents like this extremely seriously. A thorough investigation into what happened and what can be put in place to prevent this happening again has almost been concluded.'","Paul Hill had an operation at Stockton’s University Hospital of North Tees .

00d6d510d38442787f99a722e750d65a66607284,"(CNN) -- It's happened to all of us: You print something from the Web, and all you get is a sheet of paper with nothing but a URL or something equally useless. New software is designed to prevent printing blank pages from the Web, its inventor says. This printing pain in the neck happened to Hayden Hamilton so much that he invented a solution: GreenPrint, software that analyzes what a computer sends to a printer. It looks for pages that have no type or just a few lines of type (users can set the parameters). Then, the software automatically eliminates these pages from the print job. Users can reselect the pages if desired and deselect any other pages they don't want to print -- say, the pages of legal jargon at the end of an airline reservation. The software lets users eliminate images from a print job -- for instance, the maps generated in online driving directions -- thus saving ink. GreenPrint also allows users to avoid printing altogether by saving documents as PDF files. ""The average employee prints about 10,000 pages a year, and roughly 20 percent of that is waste,"" Hamilton said from his GreenPrint office in the Old Town section of Portland, Oregon. ""We estimate if [GreenPrint] got into widespread use, in the U.S. alone it would save tens of millions of trees a year and hundreds of millions of pounds"" of polluting carbon-dioxide gases. Leigh Stringer, a vice president at the Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum architectural firm, heard about GreenPrint from bloggers and decided to give it a try. ""I'm an architect by education and print a lot of large drawings as well as a lot of documents,"" she said from her Washington office. ""So the ability I have to self-select just a little bit saves a lot of paper fast."" With GreenPrint, it takes a few extra seconds to print. But, Stringer said, ""In a way, that's a good thing, because you take that pause and decide if you really wanted to print it or not."" GreenPrint tells users how many pages, and how much money, they have saved. Stringer said that based on a rate of 6½ cents per page, she paid off the $35 cost of the software in one day. But now, GreenPrint is offering a free version of the software for non-business use, supported by advertising. Tens of thousands of people have downloaded the program in the weeks since its January 28 debut. ""Our goal is nothing short of ending wasteful printing worldwide,"" Hamilton said. The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank, is using GreenPrint in a pilot project, sending feedback to the company to help fine-tune the software for the corporation's needs. And Hamilton said that more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies are testing out the product. He's hopeful that several deals will be closed this year. So, is Hamilton getting rich off this? ""Not yet,"" he said with a laugh. ""It's still early days, but hopefully over the next couple of years I'll start at least making a salary.""","Software prevents computers from printing unnecessary pages from Internet .

00d74e3677bd255c5ab794753f4bbffcfae19aef,"Pregnant actress Jaime King has revealed that it was her close friend, and fellow TV star, Lena Dunham who gave her the courage to speak out about her awful struggle to conceive her first child. Speaking to Daily Mail Online about the upcoming release of her new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII, in which she showcases her impressive vocal talents alongside those of Oscar-nominated composer J. Ralph, the 35-year-old explained that it was only after reading about Lena's own struggles with endometriosis in her book Not That Kind of Girl, that she felt able to open up about her own fertility issues. 'Lena Dunham was a big factor in my speaking out,' she said. Making moves: Jaime King, 35, lends her vocals to a breathtaking new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII's latest campaign . Expecting: Jaime announced earlier this month that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, after revealing last year that she had suffered five miscarriages before conceiving her son James . 'As a dear friend who spoke out in her book about endometriosis, she helped give me the courage to ponder what kind of impact I wanted to make on this world. And I thought, ""Hey, you have a big platform to help other women and couples."" 'I know it's not a sexy topic, I know that it's extremely private and vulnerable, but at the same time I went through years of silent suffering because no one speaks about these things or the symptoms and effects of endometriosis.' Jaime, who earlier this month revealed that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, added that she hopes her decision to speak out about her fertility struggles will help her fans to see past the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life'. People think I live a picture perfect life, and it started to upset me that I could possibly, in some way be presenting a curated, false idea of what my life is to my fans and to the world,' she said. 'Because that's false, it's a lie. In Hollywood we put out this totally unrealistic idea of a glamorous life because that's a part of the illusion that the public and system wants to see. A way to escape. 'However, why can we not do both? Be beautiful and inspiring yet be honest and support others on their journeys. If one more person can feel supported - then I will sacrifice any level of vanity and privacy for that. 'I will sacrifice anything to help educate and bring awareness to something so common, yet so oddly taboo. Because it shouldn't be. It's not about infertility per se - it's about the disease of PCOS and endometriosis and the prevention and care of that.' When it comes to setting an example for other mothers-to-be, Jaime, who is currently starring as restaurant owner Lemon Breeland in hit CW series Hart of Dixie alongside former OC star Rachel Bilson, could not be a better role model. While already balancing her TV role with her family life at home with her beloved husband and son, who is now 16 months old, the actress is also busy throwing her heart and soul into her music career - and confessed that she has no plans to slow down any time soon. Lean on me: Expectant mother Jaime revealed that she was given the courage to speak out about her own struggles with PCOS after reading about her friend Lena Dunham's own diagnosis in her book . Natural talent: Jaime explained that she has no plans to slow down on the work front, despite her pregnancy, noting that 'working always makes a pregnant woman happy' 'Working always makes a pregnant woman happy,' she said. 'Well, at least an insanely creative woman such as myself.' Thankfully, Jaime has plenty of creative projects to keep her occupied. As well as appearing in the soon-to-be launched video campaign for Grace MMXIII, the little black dress brand founded by Jens Grede and Erik Torstensson of Frame Denim, Jaime is also working on her own album with her Grace MMXIII video collaborator J. Ralph, which, she teased, will be available soon. But music is in no way a new focus for Jaime, who revealed that she has been 'working on music and writing poetry and songs for friends' for as long as she can remember. She has also worked on her fair share of music videos in the past, both in front of and behind the cameras. In 2012, Jaime starred in the video for Lana Del Ray's hit single Summertime Sadness, which was directed by her husband Kyle, with whom she has also co-directed a number of music videos in the past. But when it came to pursuing a singing career in her own right, under her own name, Jaime credits her close friend - and global singing sensation - Taylor Swift with giving her the inspiration that she needed to 'put her work out there'. 'Taylor was really the biggest catalyst for me to put my work out there, she lit a fire under me when she read my writing and her brilliance is unparalleled,' she said. 'She is fearless and incredibly brave, always authentic yet capable of reaching people on such a universal scale - it's very powerful.' And while she is finally ready to put her own music out there in the spotlight, Jaime explained that she still plans to remain a strong support to her friends, whom she describes as being 'the greats in their industry'. Number one fan: Jaime describes herself as a 'cheerleader' for her friends, such as Lena (L) and singer Taylor Swift (R), who she believes are 'greats' in their industries . Family ties: Jaime hopes that her struggles with PCOS will help her fans to see beyond the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life' and help them to find the strength to overcome their own issues . Surprise! The Hart of Dixie star announced her pregnancy with this adorable Instagram snap of her son James, who is now 16 months old . Reaching out: Jaime posted a heartfelt message to her fans on Twitter, thanking them for their continued support . 'I have an interesting dynamic with my friends because many of them are the greats in their industry,' she said. 'I have always been there to support their artistry because music has the capacity to reach people globally and truly change the planet by connecting us through song. I find by supporting someone like Taylor, or any friend who has that reach, is very important because I am deeply passionate about artists that have a voice and use it to change things for the better. 'I love being a cheerleader behind-the-scenes because in my industry I'm always front and center.' In her new music video for Grace MMXIII, however, the expectant mother happily takes center stage, showcasing her beautifully raw singing voice, as well as a number of seductive dance moves, in the dynamic and visually breathtaking clip. 'The only nerve-wracking part [about the video] is that my vocals are a live track with no auto tune, no bells and whistles, purely my voice which is the same with J. Ralph,' she said of the filming process. 'He is a visionary artist and carefully selected very rare and beautiful microphones that would naturally lend themselves to our particular style. 'For me, to sing and write, to have a band with J. Ralph is just another form of my expression as an artist. What we make musically is very poetic and dramatic which is how I've always sang - more like an old school jazz singer, not a popstar. 'I really just love every medium of art. And I want people to love it of course, to move them deeply. As a performer my goal is to always make people feel less alone in the world. To feel connected. 'But I will leave it to my friends to dominate the music industry.'","Last year, the 35-year-old, who was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, shared details about her struggle to conceive her first child .

Researchers have developed a robotic muscle, an incredible thousand times more powerful than that of a human and capable of hurling an object 50 times heavier than itself. The breakthrough relies on a material called vanadium dioxide which has a unique ability to change its size, shape and structure when heated. Scroll down for video . Robo muscle: The 'micro-bimorph dual coil' developed by U.S. scientists that can hurl an object 50 times heavier than itself . A team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in U.S. have used vanadium to build a torsional motor which works just like a human muscle, except it is far faster and more powerful. The vanadium muscle is capable of catapulting extremely heavy objects over five times its own length in just 60 milliseconds. But there's no need to worry about hoards of Herculean robots rising up and taking over the world just yet, the proto-type robo muscle is only micro-sized. Study leader, Junqiao Wu told nanowerk.com 'We've created a micro-bimorph dual coil that functions as a powerful torsional muscle, driven thermally or electro-thermally by the phase transition of vanadium dioxide. Outclassed: Even the likes of Olympic Gold medalist Jessica Ennis can't compete with the awesome power of the robotic muscle . 'Using a simple design and inorganic materials, we achieve superior performance in power density and speed over the motors and actuators now used in integrated micro-systems.' What makes Vanadium dioxide so unique is that it is an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor when it hits 67C, a bit like plastic transforming into metal. The scientists hope that this remarkable ability can be harnessed to create far more energy efficient electronic and optical devices. When heated, vanadium dioxide crystals change their structural form rapidly, both contracting and expanding at the same time. It is this particular trait that the researchers have harnessed to create the robo-muscle. Dr Wu explains: 'Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system. 'The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape. 'This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion. 'With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space.'","Breakthrough made by team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .

00d95d676d70a8f6b4a4619f021465a01c2b404f,"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- He's been labeled by many as the ""reformist,"" a man who can take Iran beyond the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Moussavi was not seen as a reformer during his stint as prime minister during the 1980s. So, when Iran's government announced over the weekend that Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country's next president, young Iranians took to the streets by the thousands alleging ballot fraud. Thousands of others around the globe championed the cause on social-networking Web sites and agreed to wear green on Monday in solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. But what is often lost in the outrage is whether Iran would look different under a Moussavi presidency.  Watch more about the vote » . Though the 67-year old is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a ""firm radical."" He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, which led to the break in ties between the countries. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents and backed the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. ""I wouldn't go as far as (call it) a 'Velvet Revolution,'"" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said of the phrase many are using to describe the rallies in Iran. ""At the end of the day, Moussavi has been more involved and been there from the very beginning of the revolution in a way that Ahmadinejad never was,"" Parsi told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Sunday. ""Moussavi was one of the founders of the revolution."" Moussavi was named prime minister in 1980. A year earlier, Iran had become an Islamic republic after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The same year, a group of students in support of the Islamic revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. In an interview with The New York Times in 1981, Moussavi defended the hostage-taking as the beginning of ""second stage of our revolution."" ""It was after this that we rediscovered our true Islamic identity,"" he said. The incident, Moussavi added, ended the ""problem of pro-American circles and their following in Iran. ""After this, we felt the sense that we could look Western policy in the eye and analyze it the way they had been evaluating us for many years."" In 1988, author Salman Rushdie released his fourth novel, 'The Satanic Verses,' which Iran said insulted Islam. The country's supreme leader called for the death of Rushdie. And Moussavi, in a radio broadcast, said the order would be carried out. Moussavi told the Financial Times in April that he would not halt Iran's uranium enrichment program if he were president. ""No one in Iran would accept suspension,"" he said. Since his stint as prime minister, Moussavi has been absent from politics. For the past 10 years, his official job has been to head the state-owned Art Center. He is a painter. The long ""20 years of silence,"" as the Iranian media dubbed it, is working to Moussavi's advantage. Of Iran's population of 70 million, almost 60 percent are younger than 28 -- too young to have lived through the 1979 revolution. To them, Moussavi represents a sea change from Ahmadinejad. While the president calls the Holocaust a myth, Moussavi has condemned the killing of Jews. While Ahmadinejad has unleashed the morality police to ensure that women cover their hair in public, Moussavi has pledged his support for women's rights. Most importantly, the youth are unhappy about the faltering economy under Ahmadinejad, with the unemployment rate topping 30 percent by some accounts. They are hungry for anyone who represents change, analysts have said. ""We have really an interesting moment of historic irony here,"" Afshin Molavi, a fellow at the New America Foundation, said on the CNN talk show Fareed Zakaria GPS. ""Moussavi is a child of the revolution. Moussavi was never a real reformer, either, when he was prime minister. ""And now he's being faced with the question: Should he unleash the young people out onto the streets who supported him -- thus threatening the very system that he fought for?"" Shahriar Etimani, an Iranian-American who was part of a demonstration Sunday in Washington, D.C., to protest the election results, said he realizes Moussavi is part of the establishment, but he remains hopeful. ""The cynical part of me says that these guys have 30 years' of experience of survival. So this will be another blip on the radar?"" he said. ""The hopeful part of me says that, 'You know what? There needs to be a catalyst and we don't know where that catalyst comes from. We don't know where that tipping point will come from.'""

A video the ministry released Monday showed the jets, with wings unattached, being pulled toward hangars. ""These jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism,"" the ministry said. The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime. The announcement follows a comment by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power, in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s ""weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,"" Kirby said. ""And we were in the process of working towards that delivery."" The advance of an al Qaeda splinter group ""couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,"" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the militant group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq.","5 Russian fighter jets arrive in Iraq; 20 more expected .

00dad5d893f836f53080de50e9b983ad2f9bcd22,"A second daughter of a 'fagin' mother who ran a lucrative family business selling goods online that the family stole from shops has been jailed. Dawn Bainbridge led a 'family business' which involved her and her daughters stealing thousands and thousands of pounds-worth of clothes from high street stores across the North which they then sold on Facebook. Their company, 'Designer Goods North East', took more than £7,000 in online payments in just four months, had detailed sales records and a debtors' book. Caitlyn Bainbridge, left, has been jaild for 16 months for being involved in a family business where goods were stolen from high street stores then sold online; her mother, Dawn, right, was the ringleader . In a note seized by police, Bainbridge's daughter Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, boasted of making £100 a week and dreamed of going it alone. At Newcastle Crown Court last month Judge Sean Morris jailed Bainbridge, 47, for 30 months and her 21-year old daughter Claire for 20 months. Then yesterday Caitlyn, 19, was sentenced to 16 months jail. Judge Morris told her: 'This was a professional, criminal family firm. 'You played your part, you were the banker, you were the marketer, you went out on some trips as well. 'Thousands and thousads of pounds worth of goods were taken in professional, planned shoplifting expeditions and professionally marketed by you on your own Paypal account and with money being withdrawn to distribute amongst the directors of the firm, your mother and your older sister.' When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000 . At Bainbridge's sentencing the court was told she was the 'mother and leader of the criminal firm'. The judge said: 'You are the villain of the piece. It's your fault your daughters are in court. Some mother.' Jamie Adams, defending Caitlyn, said: 'The whole scenario is reminiscent of something Dickens would write about. 'Fagin comes to mind in the form of her mother.' The family stole from stores in Leeds, Bradford, Guiseley, York, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham, Gateshead and Edinburgh. Their operation was uncovered by an investigator for high street chain Next, who bought clothes and proved them to have been stolen. When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000.

Researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of 'Nesski' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of Lake Labynkyr, says a new report. Intriguingly, the evidence is at a lake where native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks. Proof: This photograph, said to be the head of the underwater beast, is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a Siberian Loch Ness monster . The evidence includes a picture which, it is claimed, shows the monster, says the Siberian Times. Known as ‘the Devil', testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, told The Siberian Times that on her own scientific mission to Labynkyr she recorded ‘several seriously big underwater objects’ with sonar readings. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Humminbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Territory: Lake Labynkyr in Siberia, the alleged home of a giant 'Nesski' monster . Based on the sonic readings, researchers drew how the creature might look in real-life on the fish-finder's screen. ‘It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,"" said Dr Emeliyanova of her own close encounter. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. ‘The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,"" she said. ‘I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.’ Lady in red: The echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing, right in red, of what Nessie's Russian cousin might look like . Nesski caught: The device, normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake . Artists impression: The scientists have made a drawing of a not-so-happy monster on the screen . Other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential, said Dr Emeliyanova, a biogeographer. ‘I believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire,’ she said. She was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water. 'It was a heavy boat, only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing. The fishermen were stuck by fear. They did not see anything, no head, no jaws.’ Another 'sighting' came when a group of Russian geologists were fishing in the lake. ‘Suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature. Others, who were waiting for them on shore, started shooting, and scared the creature away,’ said a witness. Monster or myth?: The local population have given testimonies on the monster they call 'the Devil' since the 19th century . A 1953 sighting of a 'monster' in neighbouring Lake Vorota by respected Soviet geologist Viktor Tverdokhlebov was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. But now Dr Emeliyanova wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels. Strangely, despite being close to Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited town on Earth, the lake does not freeze completely in winter. There has been speculation in Russia  that Labynkyr and Vorota might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks, or  plesiosaurs, a popular theory concerning 'Nessie' in Scotland which is often depicted with a long neck. Another version is that relic killer whales could have become marooned in Labynkyr when it was attached to the sea. Some accounts even suggest the 'creature' makes a hideous primeval cry as it attacks its prey. ‘Personally, I do believe that when the information about something strange circulates among local people for so many years, it just can't be groundless, it means something is there,’ said Dr Emeliyanova. ’I know the local people very well - they are ingenuous but they do not lie.’ She stressed: ‘There are many lakes in Yakutia and around the Indigirka River, hundreds of them, big and small, their shores are more or less populated, but all the talk is about Labynkyr and Vorota lakes, and it has gone on for many dozens of years. 'It makes us think about it. And these stories about the local monster are older than those about the Loch Ness monster.’","Giant underwater monster rumoured to be living in remote Siberian lake .

00ddb03229403b968878387f0025db684f0b9682,"(CNN) -- ""Terrorists use Guantanamo Bay prison to recruit new members."" Aasif Mandvi, ""The Daily Show's"" senior correspondent, passionately made this argument as our first guest ever on the weekly CNN podcast ""The Big Three."" Mandvi thinks it's time to close Guantanamo Bay now -- and I couldn't agree with him more. President Obama brought this issue back to the forefront when he renewed his call to close the prison facility. Obama explained at his press conference on Tuesday: ""It is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. ... It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It is a recruiting tool for extremists."" Mandvi echoed President Obama's sentiments that the United States cannot simply hold people indefinitely without affording them the opportunity to answer the charges against them. ""Why can't we try these prisoners in court? We have done that with other terrorists like Timothy McVeigh,"" Mandvi said. Mandvi, who appeared in the Off-Broadway play, ""Guantanamo,"" and can be seen in the soon-to-be-released comedy film, ""The Internship,"" spoke about his discussion with the father of a Guantanamo detainee. The father made a simple plea to Mandvi: ""Try my son in court, and if you find him guilty of being a terrorist, execute him. If not, then let him go."" There are 166 prisoners in the prison. Eighty-six of them have been cleared for release by our government but have still not been set free. Many of these prisoners are on a hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention. In response, prison officials are force-feeding them by inserting tubes through their nasal passages, a practice that the U.N. Human Rights Office declared as torture. Should the U.S. government close Gitmo and put the prisoners not cleared for release on trial? That's the first issue in this week's episode of ""The Big Three,"" which features CNN contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and me. Here is a brief summary of the big three issues we took on: . 1. Guantanamo Bay Prison -- close it now? Our guest, Mandvi, emphatically argued yes. Hoover noted that more than 40 of the prisoners have been deemed too violent to ever be released. Avlon expressed concerns that national security secrets could be released if these prisoners were tried in open court. 2. Is Jason Collins, the NBA player who came out of the closet, the Jackie Robinson of gay athletes?  While all three of us applauded Collins' courage in coming out, we disagreed over its significance when compared to Jackie Robinson. Avlon argued that Robinson was far more important because racism was a much more polarizing issue at the time and also, Robinson was a far superior athlete. We all agreed, though some of the criticism Collins received makes it clear the fight to end homophobia still has a long way to go. 3. Who will voters pick in the congressional special election in South Carolina next week? Mark Sanford, a Republican former governor who famously cheated on his wife by sneaking off to Argentina, or Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a liberal-ish Democrat who is the sister of Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert? Avlon was the moderator of a recent debate between Sanford and Busch. Some were shocked that Busch brought up Sanford's past affair. I'm not shocked. In fact, I think it tells us a great deal about Sanford's character. Avlon argued that many have forgiven Bill Clinton for his escapades, why shouldn't Sanford get a second chance? Hoover noted that the demographics of the district are becoming moderate, which can help Busch win the May 7 election. We would love to hear your thoughts on these issues.

00de294185f9dbece4a827347c4f44f3c9770ed9,"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Civilians, including women and children, have been killed in an attack on a caravan of refugees in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, the Ukrainian military said Monday. The civilians were trying to escape fighting between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military but were not in an established humanitarian safety corridor when they came under fire, a military representative said. The civilians were being escorted by the Ukrainian military from the towns of Khryaschuvate and Novosvitlivka when they were attacked at 9:40 a.m. local time (2:40 a.m. ET), the Kiev-recognized Luhansk Regional Government said. A government representative confirmed that there had been ""heavy gunfire"" in the area and that the victims had been unable to call for help as mobile phone towers were down. Ukrainian Col. Andriy Lysenko told CNN that ""terrorists"" had attacked the caravan with guns from Russia. Lysenko later told media that preliminary information indicated that the attack had been an ambush. The caravan was almost destroyed, and tens of people were killed, he said. Lysenko said that people had been registering to leave with the caravan for several days before the attack. Ukraine's state information agency reported that Grad launchers and mortars had been fired at those trying to leave the war zone. There had been 25 battles in the past 24 hours, with government forces regaining part of the city of Luhansk, Lysenko said. ""Luhansk is almost fully encircled, and the operation to free it is going on right now,"" he said. The rebels had used Uragan rocket launchers for the first time, Lysenko said. Ukraine on Sunday reported gains against the rebels, saying the army had entered Donetsk and raised the Ukrainian flag in front of the district's police offices. Ukrainian forces also regained control of the strategic town of Yasynuvata in Donetsk in the southeastern part of the country, according to the official Twitter account of President Petro Poroshenko. On Monday, Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported that the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic had announced the death penalty would be introduced ""for the gravest crimes."" Once the war ended, the group would step ""on the path of humanization of the criminal law,"" RIA Novosti quoted a DPR minister as saying, after a meeting of its council Sunday. Humanitarian agencies say thousands of people in the region don't have access to water, electricity and proper medical aid. Ongoing fighting downed power lines and stopped Donetsk city's water treatment plant from working Sunday, the City Council said. The Donetsk City Council announced on its website that the water supply would be cut off starting at 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET). In a new statement Monday, it said the supply remained disrupted, with fighting hindering repairs. Ukrainian officials acknowledged Sunday that a convoy of more than 260 Russian vehicles on the border is, in fact, carrying humanitarian aid, a statement on the Ukrainian Cabinet website said. Ukraine received an inventory of the supplies Saturday, which was signed by the head of the regional International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation to Russia. But Col. Lysenko said Monday that failure to reach an agreement on safety with the ICRC had prevented a detailed inspection. The convoy initially sparked fears that Russia was trying to use a humanitarian convoy as a cover for sending in more aid and weapons for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which Russia and the rebels denied. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. What's happening in Ukraine? Progress reported in cease-fire talks . The foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France met in Berlin on Sunday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. ""We discussed the question of how we can find ways to reach an urgently needed cease-fire in eastern Ukraine,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. ""We discussed the question of how we can improve and optimize controls at the Russian-Ukrainian border."" Steinmeir said progress had been made in certain areas and the parties were looking at further talks. Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement saying the talks focused on ""the earliest possible termination of the hostilities, border control, humanitarian aid delivery to southeastern Ukraine, and creating the conditions for the earliest beginning of the process of political settlement."" ""Some progress was made on all these issues,"" it said. The United States and the European Union have applied steadily increasing sanctions against Russian officials, banks and other interests since March, when Russia annexed the Black Sea Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia's move came a month after Ukraine's parliament ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych left office after violent protests against his government in the capital, Kiev. Those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Aid or invasion?

00e0938100e0be74e844d2f0a9fce75444b8ebb7,"(CNN) -- The infiltration of a Middle Eastern terror network by a mole who helped foil a plot to blow up a U.S.-bound plane was a ""phenomenal,"" ""brilliant"" and ""powerful"" success, experts said Wednesday. It's unclear how much of the credit should go to the United States or to Saudi Arabia, for whom sources say the mole was working, but both countries have delivered a practical and psychological setback to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, analysts on the region said. Western officials describe that affiliate as al Qaeda's most dangerous. ""It's a devastating blow to al Qaeda, though not a fatal one,"" said Juan Zarate, who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under President George W. Bush. ""What this demonstrates is that we have the ability to get on the inside."" And the plot, by the same group that launched a failed attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas 2009, demonstrates the continued ""rise of the affiliates,"" he said. ""We have a decimated al Qaeda core -- the al Qaeda of 2001 that we have battled and really dismantled in many ways has metastasized and is now presenting itself in this regional form."" This latest intelligence success marks the deepest known penetration into al Qaeda, said Ali Soufan, a former FBI official who oversaw highly sensitive international terrorism cases. But he noted many intelligence efforts remain secret. ""It's a major success for the CIA and for the intelligence community,"" he said. And, he noted, as in this case with Saudi Arabia, ""overseas most of our work is done in cooperation with friendly services."" Of the al Qaeda affiliate groups trying to carry out terrorist operations today, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the closest version to the network Osama bin Laden led, Soufan said. Bruce Riedel, who spent 30 years in the CIA and was a senior adviser on the Middle East to four presidents, said thwarting the bomb plot is ""primarily a Saudi success story"" -- and not their first. ""They foiled the AQAP plot in October 2010 to send bombs to the U.S. on FedEx and UPS planes,"" he noted. That plot was foiled by an informant. Some details remain unknown. This time, Riedel said, Saudi intelligence managed to ""get access to AQAP's plot and actually get the bomb."" Still, thwarting this attack doesn't damage the organization substantially in the big picture, analysts said. ""While this is a good technical success, the harsh reality is that in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is growing, getting more powerful, recruiting more assets and taking advantage of the fact that Yemen is essentially the Humpty Dumpty of the Arabian Peninsula -- it's falling apart, broken,"" said Riedel, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank added that while it is a ""big intelligence success"" for the United States and Saudi Arabia, ""there's a limit to their success as well."" The operation did not lead intelligence services to Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or to the location where he makes the bombs. ""They were able to take out Fahd al-Quso, who's a senior operational planner in the group, but they were not able to take out this very dangerous bomb maker who's ingenious at making bombs,"" Cruickshank noted. Information from the mole led to a CIA drone strike Sunday in Yemen that killed al-Quso, 37, a senior operative of the al Qaeda affiliate. He was a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. He was convicted in a Yemeni court but escaped from jail. All the analysts who spoke to CNN expressed concern that a mole's involvement was leaked to the media. ""I think authorities, particularly the CIA, would rather not talk about this right now,"" said Zarate, now a senior adviser on counterterrorism for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. These kinds of sources ""can lead to additional counterterrorism successes or insights,"" he said. ""So the fact that this is now front page news certainly doesn't help."" Soufan, who runs a consultancy group on security issues, said, ""When you're doing operations like this, you have to do whatever you can do to protect sources and methods -- not only of the CIA but also of the other intelligence services that were involved in this. Because down the road they will be hesitant to cooperate with us."" However, Zarate said, there may be a bit of a silver lining in the leak. ""I think what this will do is it will increase the amount of vigilance and mistrust within al Qaeda circles to outsiders. They need outsiders to supplement their ranks and allow them to plot against the West. ... It will create layers of distrust and will create inefficiencies,"" Zarate said.","Analyst: The intelligence success on bomb plot shows ""the ability to get on the inside""

00e0afc8576abbd4c3971d1a796f8e8fbcdf7f3c,"Gus Poyet is confident he will still be Sunderland's head coach next season amid fevered speculation over his future. The 46-year-old Uruguayan has been linked with potential vacancies at both West Ham and Southampton in recent days, but has also found himself the subject of rumours that he could walk out of the Stadium of Light because of a power struggle behind the scenes. However, as a remarkable season drew to a close with a 3-1 home defeat by Swansea, crucially with the Black Cats still a Barclays Premier League club, Poyet insisted he was going nowhere.

To do list: Sunderland have beaten rivals Newcastle twice, been to Wembley and avoided relegation .

Asked if he expected to be in charge in August, he said: 'Yes,' before adding with a smile: 'You are scaring me now. What do you know that I don't know? 'The rumours are natural, there are so many rumours all the time. But that means you are doing something special or you are being recognised for something, whatever it is. 'It could be the way your team plays, or it could be the achievement that you made or it could be that before, I didn't have on my CV Barclays Premier League experience and now I do in a very difficult situation.' Poyet, who revealed he is in talks with ""three or four"" of the club's 11 out-of-contract and loan players, revealed he had already met owner and chairman Ellis Short to discuss the way forward, and will do so again after a short break, but was adamant there was nothing sinister about those talks. He said: 'Every single manager in the world when he finishes the season has a meeting with the chairman of the football club, winning the league, going down, in the middle, having been named somewhere else, with contract, without contract - it's natural. 'Every now and then when a manager says, ""I need to meet with the chairman to see where we are going"", you all start to think, ""He's leaving"" or ""He's not happy"" or ""There's a problem"", but it's nothing. Get in! Sunderland fans look fired up as the players walk around the pitch to acknowledge the fans on Sunday .

Swans boss Garry Monk, who was taking charge of his first game since being appointed manager on a permanent basis, was delighted with a performance which ensured his side finished 12th. He knows his honeymoon period will have ended by the time the new campaign starts, but he is relishing the opportunity to test himself once again. Monk said: 'It's been great for me, this past three and a half months, or whatever it's been, has been a learning process and a taste of what is to come. 'But then I guess from next season, I will be judged more harshly on my own merits and every single move that I make.

It's how you have to live your life, so I am just looking forward to it. 'I am looking forward to being judged, being doubted. When you have got a point to prove and you have done that your whole career, there's nothing better than trying to prove people wrong.' Monk's first task could be to attempt to keep star men like Bony and Jonjo Shelvey out of the grasp of potential suitors, although that is not something he fears. He said: 'They will be an attraction for everyone. But we are lucky, we are in a position where we don't have to sell anyone, it's up to us.'","Gus Poyet confident he will still be Sunderland manager next season .

00e17a1d97c45423c4139c4cea15180cc2c8b3b9,"(CNN) -- Four former Blackwater private security contractors faced new federal charges on Thursday, the latest chapter in a controversial political and diplomatic case over a deadly 2007 Iraqi War incident. The men were re-indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington on various manslaughter charges related to a shooting that left 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians dead and at least 18 others wounded at Nisur Square in Baghdad. The indictment alleges the men ""unlawfully and intentionally, upon a sudden quarrel and heat of passion, did commit voluntary manslaughter."" The defendants have denied all charges and said they acted in self-defense when fired upon initially by militants. A federal judge in 2008 dismissed the original case, finding the Justice Department withheld key evidence, and violated the guards' rights. But a federal appeals court later reversed that decision, leading the government to seek a fresh indictment. The incident prompted international outrage at the time, and the criminal prosecution in the United States has dragged on for years. 2011: Blackwater founder enters video game business . The killings led Iraq's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by various firms, including Virginia-based Blackwater-- now under new management and known as Academi. ""The vast majority of the U.S. contractors who served in Iraq did so with honor and integrity, but, as alleged today, these defendants abused their power through a relentless attack on unarmed civilians that recklessly exceeded any possible justification,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. ""This prosecution demonstrates our commitment to upholding the rule of law even in times of war and to bringing justice to the memories of those innocent men, women, and children who were gunned down in Baghdad more than six years ago,"" he said.

00e25cd73a0992fca39f7477d0d906b43d7525f6,"City girl: Billie Piper in London earlier this week . She put her wild child past behind her and settled down to a quiet family life in the country. But seven years later, it seems Billie Piper has finally tired of her rural idyll and is moving back to the bright city lights. The 32-year-old actress and her actor husband Laurence Fox, 36, have put their secluded Sussex cottage up for sale and bought a smart townhouse in north London. Miss Piper – who shot to fame playing the companion in Doctor Who and a prostitute in the TV drama Secret Diary of a Call Girl – has been flooded with work after struggling to find roles for several years. She is currently in stage farce Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and recently played a poor Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful. Meanwhile Mr Fox – who is best known for starring in ITV detective drama Lewis – is busy recording a music album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud theatre. It seems the young couple, who are parents to two sons Winston, five, and Eugene, two, no longer have time to relax in the countryside. When they married in 2007, they settled down in a picturesque, oak-timbered cottage near Midhurst, West Sussex, which they bought for £725,000. They soon learned to appreciate its views of rolling fields, large garden and friendly village pub, and bought a horse called Chutney, two pics named Boris and Barack and three chickens. Mr Fox seemed to appreciate the rustic simplicity even more than his wife. In 2011, he said he loved their ‘boringly normal’ life, adding: ‘I never liked London. I always said I wanted to live in the country. I’m an outdoorsy sort of person; I go fishing, take my dog out to the pub.’ But it seems Miss Piper, who often says she is less laid back than her husband, began to tire of the good life, especially when he had to spend time in Los Angeles looking for acting work. She told an interviewer she began to feel bored in the countryside after the birth of their first son. She said: ‘I did go a bit Sylvia Plath down there. Staring at the condensation on the window and wondering where it comes from. For sale: Piper is getting rid of her country house in West Sussex and moving back to London . ‘Following slugs in the garden that hadn’t moved a foot, and feeling a bit desperate. Laurence was filming when I first had Winston. I’d had an emergency caesarean and I could barely walk. I was alone in the country with a new born baby for three weeks.’ And it seems couple’s elderly neighbours did not immediately warm to the actress thanks to her racy reputation and role in ITV’s Secret Diary of a Call Girl. In 2010, she revealed: ‘A few of the older locals actually believe I’m a whore. They love Laurence because he’s in Lewis — his fan club are in their mid-60s upwards. ‘It’s sickening. They look at me and they are like, “That s***! How could you dirty yourself with her? She’s corrupted you”.’ Girl about town: piper starring asescort Belle in ITV's London-based Secret Diary of a Call Girl . Sci-fi: Piper playing Doctor Who's companion Rose, with John Hurt as the Doctor in the BBC hit . Two years ago, the couple sold their horse after it threw Mr Fox off repeatedly, rehomed the pigs at a nearby farm when they became too big to keep in the garden and gave the chickens to their local pub. Last year, they paid £1.7million for a four-bedroom house in north London. Now they appear to have decided to stay there for good as their acting careers flourish in the capital, putting their Sussex home up for sale with an asking price of £825,000 last month. While she may prefer city life, it appears Miss Piper has not yet adjusted to the busy London traffic. She was recently quizzed by police after she collided with a cyclist while attempting a U-turn in her Volkswagen Golf near their home. She was not arrested or charged.","Billie Piper and husband Laurence Fox have bought a London townhouse .

""The Tonight Show"" just hit a seven-week high in total viewers with 3.52 million (his best since the week of January 28-February 1) and a four-week high in the 18-49 demo with 982,000 viewers (his best since February 18-22), according to Nielsen ratings. The ratings bump for the week of March 18-22 came as Leno began taking nightly jabs at his employers — like referring to them as snakes — as news hit that a succession plan was in the works to replace him with Jimmy Fallon. As it now stands, Leno has outranked ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" among 18-49 viewers for the last 18 weeks in a row while topping ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" for nine of their 11 head-to-head weeks. In total viewers, Leno has averaged more than the Late Show for 22 weeks in a row and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" for 11 of 11 weeks. NBC has yet to confirm or comment on the succession plan, other than to say Fallon is getting a fancy new set in New York, where The Tonight Show is expected to move. Though plenty of industry watchers question whether it's the right time to bump Leno, speculation continues that Fallon may start as early as February, after the network's telecast of the Winter Olympics. Leno continued his war of words against NBC on Wednesday, with this joke about the network's Monday lineup. ""'The Voice' and 'Revolution' moved NBC into the No. 2 position. You know what that means? Between Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We're number two! We're number two! And I've been saying that for the last week — NBC is a big No. 2. Haven't I been saying that?""

00e2a99fac3d40621d262d9314b50ad94ded0536,"(CNN) -- Two Burmese migrants accused of the brutal murder of two British tourists on a popular tourist island in Thailand last month have retracted their confessions, a lawyer representing them says. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, who have been in custody since October 1, had admitted to killing David Miller and raping and murdering Hannah Witheridge on Koh Tao, according to Thai police. However the men now say they did so under duress after being physically abused by police, Surapong Kongchantuk, the head of the Lawyers Council of Thailand, which is acting for the two suspects, told CNN Wednesday. Surapong said the men deny the murder and rape charges, and that an official complaint to the justice department of Samui, which has jurisdiction over the island, has been filed. They appealed for fair treatment for the two accused, he added. Thai police could not be immediately reached for a response. The two Britons were found dead on a beach on the island, a popular tourist destination, on September 15. Both were partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads. A hoe with blood on it was found close by, police said. Police Commissioner Gen. Somyot Poompanmuang previously told CNN that DNA in semen taken from Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men. ""The DNA matching result is out already and they matched with DNA found on the female victim,"" he said. Torture claims denied . Reports that the police extracted confessions through torture first surfaced earlier this month, when Burmese media reported that its two nationals had complained to a visiting lawyer attached to the Myanmar embassy. The revelation prompted national police chief Somyot Poompanmuang to hold a press conference in Bangkok to deny allegations his officers had tortured the suspects. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has called for a full, independent investigation into reports of misconduct by police officers. Allegations of torture should be investigated independently, and not by the Thai police, Richard Bennett, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific Program director, told CNN earlier this month. He also said there were questions of due process that had arisen, specifically the absence of legal counsel prior to the confession, and difficulties with interpretation. ""There is a fairly long-standing record of ill-treatment,"" in Thailand, he said. ""Impunity is also a problem. If the investigation shows ill-treatment, those responsible should pay."" The fact that the suspects are migrant workers, many of whom work in Thailand illegally, makes them more vulnerable, he added. Journalist Kiki D in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Burmese migrants who had previously confessed to double murder retract confessions .

00e45018727b94b80f2d04301b9956616d70f562,"The judge in the Oscar Pistorius trial has been placed under police protection after her decision to acquit the athlete murder sparked anger around the world. Several legal groups in South Africa have expressed concern about threats and harsh criticism of Judge Thokozile Masipa which they say could amount to racism and contempt of court. Judge Masipa, one of the first black female judges in South Africa, last week found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, but not guilty of the more serious charge of murder. Scroll down for video . South African Judge Thokozile Masipa (pictured delivering her verdicts) has been placed under police protection after receiving threats over her decision to acquit Oscar Pistorius of murder . Some South Africans said they were surprised and even shocked when she ruled last week that the Paralympic champion was negligent but did not intend to kill when he fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door. Pistorius said he thought a dangerous intruder was in his house. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally killed Steenkamp after an argument. Police protection for Masipa has been stepped up since the verdict on Friday in the sensational case, South African media reported. The case will return to the global spotlight when Pistorius, who is free on bail, appears before the judge for a sentencing hearing on October 13. In a statement, three legal groups described a 'wave of criticism' directed at Masipa that in some cases could border on hate speech, defamation and contempt of court. Pistorius leaves the court in Pretoria after being cleared of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, but found guilty of culpable homicide and has been granted bail until being sentenced next month . The comments include allegations that the judge is corrupt, as well as attacks on her race and gender. 'In judging, there's a lot of analysis of the information before the court and applying the law to what is before you,' Thabang Pooe, a researcher at legal group SECTION27, said today. 'Attacking the judge's integrity and making insinuations of bribery or that she's not fit because she's a woman, or that she's black, means that you're breaking down the belief in the law.' Masipa, 66, is a former social worker and journalist who became one of the first black female judges in South Africa, which shed white racist rule in 1994. Her supporters have described her as a symbol of accomplishment in a country where poverty and unemployment remain obstacles for many people. The legal groups, including SECTION27, the Legal Resources Centre and the Centre for Child Law, said people are entitled to disagree with the verdict and that the prosecution can appeal. South African media react to the decision not to convict the Paralympian of murder . Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to appeal after sentencing. The sentence for a culpable homicide conviction is at the judge's discretion and can range from a suspended sentence and a fine to as much as 15 years in prison. Legal experts have cited five years as a guideline. Many legal analysts agreed with the judge's ruling that Pistorius could not be found guilty of premeditated murder. But some believe the law supported a conviction on a lesser murder charge on the grounds that Pistorius knew someone - in his version, a perceived intruder - was behind the toilet door and also knew that firing four bullets into the door could cause that person's death. James Grant, an associate professor of law at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said in an online analysis that 'there appear to be errors of law' in Masipa's judgment. 'The effect is that, if the state does appeal, and one may well expect that it will, Pistorius continues to face the prospect of a murder conviction,' Grant wrote. Meanwhile, South African sports officials . have said Pistorius can compete for South Africa again, as long as his . running doesn't go against the ruling of the judge.","Judge Masipa criticised for only convicting Paralympian of manslaughter .

Seth Matlins, a father-of-two and former high-powered advertising executive based in Los Angeles, California, has launched a petition aimed at Dove on Change.org, which has so far garnered 3,758 signatures. Although he doesn't outright accuse the beauty giant of any specific wrongdoing, Mr Matlins is asking for two 'Hero Pledges': full disclosure to its customers as to whether it has or hasn't Photoshopped its images, and the avoidance of running Photoshopped ads where kids can see them, i.e. 'billboards, bus shelters, mall kiosks, and the back covers of magazines.' Scroll down for video . Demands: Seth Matlins' petition (pictured) asks Dove to lets consumers know when it has Photoshopped an image, and if it has, to display these images only where kids can't readily see them . The petition, which is 1,241 signatures away from its goal, is accompanied by a still from Dove's own 2006 campaign; a time lapse video which sees a make-up free model styled, transformed and aggressively Photoshopped, and ends with the caption: 'No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.' Mr Matlins' petition reads: 'As a father of two young children, I've always appreciated the idea behind Dove's Real Beauty campaign, and the brand's understanding that the way women and girls are portrayed, both literally (through words) and visually (in pictures), has a big impact on how they view themselves and who they aspire to be.' The outspoken father has an eight-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son, and runs a blog with his wife Eva called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem. He argues that Photoshopped ads should be kept out of the sights of impressionable youths because 'kids don't have the ability to process or understand what they're seeing.' Practice what you preach: The petition is accompanied by a still from Dove's own 2006 campaign - a time lapse video which sees a make-up free model (right) styled, transformed and aggressively Photoshopped (left) Mr Matlins claims he is 'starting' with Dove because: 'They've been championing ‘Real Beauty’ for ten years, and because they know more about the health consequences created by the false, unrealistic representations of women and girls in Photoshopped advertising, than most.' He points to Dove's own research, which is listed on its website and states that while 72per cent of girls globally feel 'tremendous' pressure to be beautiful, only 22per cent are actually comfortable describing themselves as such. Mr Matlins hopes that Dove will lead the way in signing the Truth in Advertising Pledge and thus encouraging other advertisers to follow. 'If they don't,' he says, 'Let's ask them why not...after a decade of ""real beauty"" it seems a fair question.' 'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age' In a statement to the New York Daily News, Dove said: 'When the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty launched in 2004, we made a commitment to all women that we would not distort any of our images to create an unrealistic view of beauty. 'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age, thereby representing them as they genuinely are.' Parents: Mr Matlins (center left) has an eight-year-old daughter (left) and a seven-year-old son (right), and runs a blog with his wife Eva (center right) called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem . Concerns: The father said, 'Two weeks ago, my daughter [far left and far right] looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, ""Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?""' In a May interview with Fashionista, Mr Matlins opened up about why he left his 'successful' and 'lucrative' career in advertising to stand on the opposite side and campaign for stricter regulations in the very same industry. 'I left behind a pretty successful . career to do this... But if I can help my kids . and other kids grow up happier, I'll feel good' 'Two weeks ago, my daughter - apropos to nothing - looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, ""Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?""' he told the publication. 'My heart shatters into a thousand pieces, and I don't even know what to say.' He added: 'I left behind a pretty successful career to do this, and sometimes I look at the big check I didn't cash every two weeks and I think, ""That was dumb!""

'I'm done,' a witness heard him say to police. Police said at a news conference that they received a tip that led them to a wooded residential part of Moncton, New Brunswick, where they found 24-year-old Justin Bourque, suspected in the deadliest attack on Canada's national police force in nearly a decade.

Nearly 300 police officers searched for Bourque, who was seen going in and out of a wooded area. RCMP Supt. Marlene Snowman said Bourque was arrested at 12:10 a.m. She said he wasn't carrying any weapons, but some were found nearby. Prosecutors and police declined to comment when asked if the guns were acquired legally. Bourque turned himself over without incident. Bearded and shaggy-haired, Bourque made a brief court appearance Friday afternoon, where he was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. In aqua-colored jail clothes, he stared ahead intently, clearly paying attention but showing little emotion. He nodded when the judge said his name. He will be back in court July 3 as he seeks a lawyer. A court appointed legal aid attorney represented him Friday. Prosecutors say they were not requesting a psychiatric evaluation, seeing no need for one. The defence agreed. There was a high-level security at the appearance, including officers with drawn weapons outside the courtroom. Two other officers - Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen - were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening.","Thousands of mourners attended funerals for three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers killed last week .

00e87dec09d988e3c457ae44c318c79fe7160de8,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court voiced deep free speech concerns Tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty. Selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute. The justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decade-old statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals. But media groups and the National Rifle Association were among those who say the law is overly broad. ""It's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say: You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, movies cannot be made"" showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused, for example. ""What about people who like to see human sacrifices?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito, somewhat sarcastically. ""Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay-per-view, you know, on the Human Sacrifice Channel. They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?"" He seemed to indicate strongly it was not, and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. Watch an excerpt of the tapes » . A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his ""Dogs of Velvet and Steel"" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in ""Sporting Dog Journal,"" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was ""Catch Dogs,"" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a ""gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,"" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, ""research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty."" Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. Several media organizations have come out in support of Stevens, worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bull-fighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. A number of justices too had concerns, raising a number of hypotheticals, a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated. ""Why not do a simpler thing?"" suggested Justice Stephen Breyer. ""Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done."" ""You have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""How can you tell these aren't political videos? With organizations like PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the distinction between Stevens' videos and news items. ""Tell me what the difference is between these videos and [filmmaker] David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit,"" she said. Roma's 2006 independent film ""Off the Chain"" consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage. Among the wide-ranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cock fighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the Justice Department, said the law was ""narrowly targeted"" and had exceptions specifically for ""religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value."" ""This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty,"" said Katyal. Justice Samuel Alito appeared most supportive of the government's views. He asked about selling of so-called ""crush"" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. ""The people who produce 'crush' videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is sexually exciting,"" he said, clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. When Stevens' lawyer Patricia Millett launched into a caveat-laden answer, Alito broke in. ""You are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited?"" he asked. ""Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted."" Congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of ""crush"" videos. The Humane Society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed. Millett said ""Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area."" She noted that if the law is upheld, it would only be the second time the Supreme Court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. ""The problem in this case, was that Congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our Constitution upside down,"" Millett told reporters later. The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. The case is U.S. vs. Stevens (08-769) and a ruling is expected in several months.","The justices heard an hour of debate about scope and intent of decade-old statute .

00e8a1c6e038a833ed30d92f911267a2f8f238be,"(CNN) -- The women's lives have taken different paths since the days they were born. Brenda Vazquez is a 29-year-old elementary school teacher in Matamoros, Mexico. Laura Castro lives across the border in Brownsville, Texas. She is a 32-year-old housewife who helps her husband manage several stores. They share one thing in common: Both say they were delivered by midwives in south Texas, but pressured by U.S. Border Patrol agents to deny their U.S. citizenship. Their problems began, according to attorney Jaime Diez, when a group of midwives along the U.S.-Mexico border were found guilty of selling birth certificates to people who were not born in the United States. ""Now all the midwives in the area are suspected of committing fraud,"" said Diez, who said his office regularly sees cases of people delivered by midwives in Texas. Some of them are struggling to get passports because officials question the validity of their birth certificates, he said. Others have been deported and had their identification documents confiscated at the border, he said. Vazquez, who Diez is representing in a federal lawsuit filed last week, said she was intimidated into signing a document swearing she was not a U.S. citizen at a border crossing in Brownsville, Texas, last year. ""He said, 'You'd better cooperate with me, because if you don't, you're going to jail. I had to lie and say that I was not a citizen. ... I was quite scared. I was crying,"" the second-grade teacher said. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said he could not comment about Vazquez's case or other such cases ""due to pending legal action."" Border patrol agents are ""obligated to ensure that documentation presented to establish citizenship is proper and correct and was issued to the person presenting the documents,"" spokesman Bill Brooks said in a statement. A 2012 report from the Texas Office of the Inspector General said a fraud investigation had been ""substantiated"" and Vazquez's birth record had been flagged, noting Vazquez's signed confession and the fact that officials found birth certificates for Vazquez in both the United States and Mexico. The report said the case would not be prosecuted because it was beyond the statute of limitations. Vazquez said her parents obtained the Mexican birth certificate so she could study in Mexico. Vazquez said she has never lived in the United States, but wants to fight to regain her citizenship. ""With crime as it is in Mexico, something might happen, and as a citizen I would go live there,"" she said. Laura Castro said she faced a similar situation with her mother and sister at the same border crossing in 2009. ""My sister got desperate and signed the paper,"" Castro said. A border patrol agent told her that her mother had admitted to buying false identification documents for the family. ""He kept asking me the same thing, and I replied the same thing, that I was a citizen. ... I said I was not going to sign because I did nothing wrong, and they let me go. ... They sent me back to Mexico,"" she said. Nearly a year later, authorities returned Castro her U.S. passport after she filed a lawsuit, she said. But Castro said she remains frustrated. ""We were very humiliated. We were treated like criminals,"" she said. The issue has come up before. In 2008, the ACLU sued the federal government on behalf of nine people, arguing that authorities were unfairly discriminating against passport applicants. ""For countless Latinos who were delivered by midwives in the Southwest ... trying to obtain a passport has become an exercise in futility,"" the ACLU said in a statement at the time. ""Although midwifery has been a common practice for more than a century, particularly in rural and other traditionally underserved communities, the U.S. government has imposed unsurpassable hurdles on midwife-delivered Latinos to prove their citizenship and eligibility for U.S. passports -- even when their citizenship has already been established in the past."" In a 2009 settlement, the State Department agreed to a new set of procedures for such passport applications. But the settlement said the department denied the ACLU's accusations, and noted that ""there has been significant fraud by midwives and other birth attendants certifying births as occurring in the United States when they have not occurred in the United States."" Diez said U.S. authorities need to do more to address the problem. ""If they doubt that a person was born here and they can't criminally charge them, then give them a process in which they can send their documents to be investigated, give them a chance to be before a judge with a lawyer, and in which there could be a process in which they make things right. That's how it should be when we are talking about the citizenship of someone,"" he said.","Suspicion of midwives has caused immigration problems for many, an attorney says .

00eaf1c06f1e3ecd48160b43f3b3cd196a319c8a,"(CNN) -- Andrew Breitbart, the conservative blogger whose posting of a sexually explicit photo of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner led to the congressman's downfall, has died, his attorney confirmed Thursday. He was 43. Joel Pollak, editor-in-chief and in-house counsel for Breitbart's website, Breitbart.com, posted a statement confirming his death. ""Andrew passed away unexpectedly from natural causes shortly after midnight this morning in Los Angeles,"" the statement read. ""We have lost a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a dear friend, a patriot and a happy warrior."" Ed Winter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner, said Breitbart was pronounced dead 19 minutes after midnight at UCLA Medical Center. An autopsy is planned for Friday, Winter said, but the Los Angeles Police Department said it is not investigating the circumstances of his death. Compassion and politics: Strange bedfellows . Breitbart was the first to post Weiner's infamous Twitter photos last year, in which the married congressman appeared barechested and in his underpants in pictures sent to a woman online. Weiner eventually stepped down amid the scandal. Breitbart's regular appearances on FOX News, his websites and his speeches to conservative groups made him a star on the right and a villain to the left. Republican presidential candidates quickly responded to news of Breitbart's death. Former Sen. Rick Santorum called him a ""powerful force"" who was ""constantly out there driving and pushing."" ""What a huge loss, in my opinion, to our country and certainly to the conservative movement,"" Santorum said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted: ""Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity."" And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called Breitbart a ""brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father."" Breitbart was a driving force in the conservative tea party movement. In a posting on the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote that Breitbart was an ""amazing patriot"" who ""relished fighting those who would destroy this great country."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a former GOP presidential contender, said Breitbart ""fought for what he believed in, exposing government corruption and media bias. His spirited voice will be missed, but not forgotten."" Breitbart came under heavy criticism in 2010 for posting an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod, who is black, appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. Sherrod was forced to resign over the video, which appeared on another of Breitbart's websites, BigJournalism.com. A full version of the speech showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer. The department later offered her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented. Sherrod issued a brief statement Thursday saying only she was surprised by the news and that her prayers go out to Breitbart's family. Opinion: How Andrew Breitbart changed news . ""The news of Mr. Breitbart's death came as a surprise to me when I was informed of it this morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart's family as they cope during this very difficult time."" Breitbart also posted video of a sting operation against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, which showed conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute seeking advice on how to set up a brothel. The video prompted a groundswell of action against the organization, including a limited investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states. ACORN went bankrupt and closed its doors. Breitbart got his start helping to run the original right-wing online media behemoth the Drudge Report and helped launch The Huffington Post before founding his own websites. Drudge Report founder Matt Drudge on Thursday said Breitbart was a ""constant source of energy, passion and commitment"" in the site's early days and that the two ""shared a love of headlines, a love of the news, an excitement about what's happening."" The statement on Breitbart.com Thursday included a portion of the new conclusion he wrote to his book, ""Righteous Indignation"": . ""I love my job. I love fighting for what I believe in. I love having fun while doing it. I love reporting stories that the Complex refuses to report. I love fighting back, I love finding allies, and -- famously -- I enjoy making enemies. ""Three years ago, I was mostly a behind-the-scenes guy who linked to stuff on a very popular website. I always wondered what it would be like to enter the public realm to fight for what I believe in. I've lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I've gained hundreds, thousands -- who knows? -- of allies. At the end of the day, I can look at myself in the mirror, and I sleep very well at night.""

Plans to store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use are set to be scuppered by the Liberal Democrats. They are ready to oppose a proposed £2billion law affecting everyone online or using a mobile phone which has been criticised as a snoopers' charter. The potential threat comes as a powerful committee of MPs and peers is expected to publish a series of damning criticisms of the Communications Data Bill next week. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is expected to oppose the plans to store billions of pieces of private information in their entirety . These will include the verdict that it infringes civil liberties and invades privacy. Crucially, the committee will also suggest that ministers have not made the case for the measure. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is expected to use those conclusions to oppose the plans in their entirety. He has previously insisted that he will not approve anything which threatens civil liberties. A party source said: 'Obviously given how strongly Nick felt on this, we would take the recommendations of the committee very seriously.' Mr Clegg met the Prime Minister this week to discuss the issue and was 'non-committal' about the Bill's future, the BBC reported. Isabelle Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, called on MPs to 'oppose this snoopers' charter which has no place in a free society'. Officials warn that unless a law is brought in new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images . She added: 'It would waste billions . and pave the way for blanket surveillance of innocent citizens' personal . data. Home Office evidence to the committee has been woeful.' The . Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 . months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will . protect national security. Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue. Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data. The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them. The joint committee on the Bill has examined it in detail and is likely to conclude that even collecting the data is open to abuse. It may also contradict claims that it is possible to separate details of messages from their content. There is strong opposition to the Bill among Lib Dem and Tory backbenchers. Crucially, Labour has yet to indicate how it will vote. Committee member Julian Huppert has said the Bill is 'botched' and 'unfit in principle and detail'.","Party opposes £2bn law affecting everyone online or using mobile phone .

The Czech Republic has long been regarded as one of the most popular destinations for British men's stag parties: At one point, it was reported that 20 per cent of all weekend crime in Prague was caused by them. Perhaps one reason so many tourists flock to the Czech Republic is because of its relaxed attitude to sex, affairs and alcohol. The country has been deemed the most accepting of moral issues in the world, closely followed - bizarrely - by Japan. Cheers! Prague is one of the world's most popular destinations for stag parties, one pictured here. In a recent survey entitled Global Views of Morality, the Czech Republic was the most accepting of affairs, alcohol and sex . According to The Pew Research Center’s 2013 Global . Attitudes Project, Europe, Japan and countries within South . America are the most tolerant to premarital sex, with the Czech Republic coming out on top. 67 per cent of those questioned in the . survey from the country said they were accepting, compared to 59 per . cent in Greece, 57 per cent in Germany, 42 per cent in Italy and 38 . percent in Britain. Britain is amongst one of the most relaxed attitudes in Europe towards sex before marriage, but one of the most disapproving of extramarital affairs. French kiss: France was the second most accepting country when questioned about extramarital affairs in a recent morality survey. French President Francois Hollande, pictured here, famously had an affair . Just four per cent of British respondents deemed them acceptable, along with Australia and Canada. 17 per cent is the figure for the Czech Republic, the highest of all the countries when asked whether affairs were acceptable. It is followed closely by France, where the figure was 12 per cent. Outside of Europe, Venezuela is the most relaxed in terms of premarital sex, with 61 per cent believing it is acceptable. The Pew Research Center’s survey asked 40,117 respondents in 40 countries what they thought about eight topics often discussed as moral issues: extramarital affairs, gambling, homosexuality, abortion, premarital sex, alcohol consumption, divorce, and the use of contraceptives. They were asked to rate each topic as morally acceptable, unacceptable, or not a moral issue. Overall, whilst the Czech Republic is the most morally relaxed, according to the results Japan follows closely behind. 66 per cent of the country are accepting of alcohol use, 55 per cent accepting of divorce, 47 per cent of premarital sex and 44 per cent accepting of abortion, a figure even higher than in the US, where just 17 per cent think abortion is OK. The US are also more morally opposed to homosexuality than Japan. Just 23 per cent of those questioned think being gay is acceptable.

00ebb7109898734bde3ead005ebbc591cf8dbcc9,"By . Meghan Keneally . New spin: The parody video plays off of Sorkin's HBO show The Newsroom . Aaron Sorkin fans had reason to rejoice Tuesday morning as comedian Amy Schumer released a parody video of his show, The Newsroom. The parody version took the writer's iconic walk-and-talks, moral dilemmas and sexual politics to a different venue: a fast food restaurant. 'The Foodroom' gives a four-minute foray into the fictitious world of McDalmonds, where a cranky male manager is in a moral lock-of-horns with his corporate overlords. Sound familiar? Similar plot lines . have been used in many of Sorkin's shows, whether it be the latest . iteration in The Newsroom or earlier series like Sports Night or Studio . 60 On The Sunset Strip. (If 'corporate' was subbed out for . 'Republicans', there would be examples in The West Wing as well.) Showing . that the spoof was done in good fun, the male protagonist was played by . Sports Night alum Josh Charles, while his pesky female sidekick and . former flame is taken on by Schumer. Walk-and-talk: The parody film was made by comedian Amy Schumer (seen in the background) and Josh Charles, who previously starred in Sorkin's earlier TV series Sports Night . In . the clip, Charles' charactor JJ McAhoy (which is a clear homage to Jeff . Daniel's character in The Newsroom, Will McAvoy) is resistant to a . healthy change that his overlords want to make in adding apple slices to . their kids meals. 'Silly me, I thought we stood for something around here,' McAhoy says in disgust. Schumer, . whose sketch comedy show will feature the clip on her Comedy Central . show tonight, goes on to buck him up and encourage him to take first the . pragmatic route before returning to his moral high ground. Moral highground: Though the spoof centers around a fast food chain's resistance to healthy food, it takes its cues from themes seen in much of Sorkin's work . Big finish: The romantic sub plot also mimics the gender relations on Sorkin's shows . In a romantic interlude, she takes a jab . at the way in which Sorkin's female characters are portrayed as at times . hapless and entirely beholden to their love interests. Poking fun: Aaron Sorkin has taken part in previous parodies, including one on 30 Rock . 'I worked my way up to be a GM of a Sbarro in Tel Aviv, and then one day, I was stuffing cous cous into a calzone and then one day I realized a woman's life is worth nothing except if she's making a great man greater,' she says as they share a private moment by a deep fryer. This is far from the first time that Sorkin's distinctive style has been spoofed by famous fans, as former West Wing stars have created their own videos in the guise of their old characters to help get out the vote for one of their siblings who was running for office. The Oscar-winning writer himself has poked fun at his walk-and-talk formula in an appearance in 30 Rock. Sorkin is currently believed to be putting the final touches on the script for The Newsroom's third season which will air in September, but he has appearances scheduled at the Tribeca Film Festival next week and the Nantucket Film Festival in June, where he is being honored with their Screenwriter's Tribute. Until the HBO show returns, or his fast-paced writing style gets back on the big screen with his Steve Jobs biopic, fans can get quick refresher through the spoof.

00ec130aa4857442169aa027c5b38aadbebfd035,"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- CIA operatives are providing intelligence from Libya, where opposition forces are on the run and the defiant government suffered the embarrassing defection of its foreign minister Wednesday. The NATO-led coalition, which is enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians from the intense fighting, got no help from the weather in its ongoing efforts to protect the fragile opposition movement. ""The weather conditions did not allow close combat support by aircraft in the last couple of days,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Moammar Gadhafi's government, for its part, kept up the war of words. State-run Libyan TV late Wednesday quoted a military source as saying a ""civilian location was shelled tonight in the city of Tripoli by the colonizing crusader aggression."" Amid debate on whether the allies will arm the retreating and undertrained rebels, a U.S. intelligence source told CNN the CIA is in the country to increase the ""military and political understanding"" of the situation. ""Yes, we are gathering intel firsthand and we are in contact with some opposition entities,"" said the source. The White House refused to comment on a Reuters report that President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel troops. ""I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney in a statement. ""We're not ruling it out or ruling it in. We're assessing and reviewing options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the Libyan people, and have consulted directly with the opposition and our international partners about these matters."" According to the Reuters report, Obama signed the covert aid order, or ""finding,"" within the past few weeks. Such findings are required for the CIA to conduct secret operations, the report said. A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly could not confirm the finding, but noted when there are crises like this, ""you look at all instruments of national power."" In early March, a U.S. official told CNN ""the intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground"" in Libya. British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons that he has not ruled out arming the Libyan opposition, but added that Britain has not made the decision to do so. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provided classified briefings to House and Senate members who asked whether the United States intended to arm the rebels, participants told CNN. Clinton and Gates made clear that no decision had been made, and Congress members from both parties said they believed it would be a bad idea, according to participants. Regarding the committing of U.S. forces to the U.N.-backed operation, the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act. It notes that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission. Clinton told members of Congress the administration acted within the requirements of the War Powers Act and needed no authorization for further decisions on the mission, lawmakers said. The opposition got a boost Wednesday with news that Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa willingly traveled to London and told the government there that he has resigned, the United Kingdom Foreign Office said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, who has been reporting from Libya for several weeks, said that Koussa's departure is a significant blow, but not a critical loss to the regime. A Foreign Office spokesperson said Koussa was one of the most senior figures in Gadhafi's government ""and his role was to represent the regime internationally -- something that he is no longer willing to do."" The department provided no other details on the surprise move. CNN's Nic Robertson, who previously met with Koussa, said the former head of intelligence once was a stalwart defender of the government. The Senate's Rogers called Moussa's defection ""huge news."" Libya's opposition said its fighters are executing a ""tactical withdrawal"" from a swath of territory they once controlled, a move that comes as Gadhafi's forces relentlessly pound them. Col. Ahmed Bani, speaking at a news conference in the opposition capital of Benghazi on Wednesday, said his forces are being outgunned by the superior military power of loyalists, spared the wrath of coalition airstrikes. They have been pushed eastward over the last two days after CNN reported on Sunday that rebels took Brega, Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad and reached a town just east of Sirte. Rebel forces have now lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the Brega area, Bani said. Ajdabiya, which is east of Brega, will be prepared as a ""defense point"" if the withdrawal continues farther east, he said. CNN's Wedeman said the rebels continue to have no effective command and control. Bani called on the international community to supply opposition fighters with better and more powerful weapons to hold off the Gadhafi forces. He said the opposition was open to foreign troops training rebel fighters. Bani asked for tanks, heavy artillery and communications and logistics equipment. The rebels have been demanding an end to Gadhafi's almost 42-year rule in Libya, but they have been facing ""sustained attacks in the face of the coalition bombing"" in Misrata, Ras Lanuf, and Bin Jawad, Robertson reported. In an address to the House of Commons in London on Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""regime forces have intensified their attacks, driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days."" He cited the violence in the western town of Misrata. ""Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday, with further loss of civilian life, including children, from mortars, sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers,"" Hague said. In the outskirts of Ajdabiya -- which was recently taken over by opposition forces -- Gadhafi's regime planted several dozen land mines, Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday. ""Given the pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area, the mines were clearly laid while government forces were in Ajdabiya,"" the group said. Human Rights Watch also said 370 people are missing in the eastern part of the country, with some suspected to be in government custody. That list includes rebel fighters and civilians, including doctors, the group said.

00eca9c1c3adbd297f9582003396db45b41ac710,"The deadliest outbreak of Ebola virus on record has sparked fears that the killer virus could spread from West Africa to other regions and continents. The outbreak began with just a handful of cases in Guinea in March. Since then, that number has grown to 909 confirmed cases and another 414 probable or suspected in that country, Sierra Leone and Liberia and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. Some 729 people of the 1,323 total confirmed and possible infections have died, reports WHO as of July 27. The WHO says ""drastic action is needed"" to contain Ebola, warning that previously undetected chains of transmission are boosting the numbers of sick and increasing the chances that the disease spreads from Africa. ""This epidemic is without precedent,"" said Bart Janssens, director of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders. ""It's absolutely not under control, and the situation keeps worsening. ... There are many places where people are infected but we don't know about it."" What's the latest? The Ebola outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where authorities have been working to contain the virus. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced Wednesday that, ""without exceptions, all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education."" She also declared Friday a nonworking day ""to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities."" On the same day, the Peace Corps said it was temporarily removing its 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak. The announcement comes as two Peace Corps volunteers were isolated after coming in contact with someone who ended up dying of Ebola, a spokeswoman for the group said. She said these two Americans ""are not symptomatic,"" and the Peace Corps will work to return them to the United States once they get medical clearance to travel. Concerns about Ebola aren't confined to those three countries. Last week, a Liberian government official who had contracted the virus died in isolation at a hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized American citizen who worked in Liberia, flew to Nigeria intending to attend a conference. After exhibiting symptoms upon arrival July 20, he was hospitalized and died on July 25. He's the first American to die in the outbreak, though two other U.S. aid workers in Liberia have contracted Ebola and are being treated. Sawyer's was the only known case in Nigeria, WHO said. And the British government convened an emergency meeting to discuss the threat of Ebola to the UK, even though no case has been reported there. Officials discussed what measures could be taken if UK nationals in West Africa should become infected, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. Why was someone infected with Ebola allowed on a plane? It is unknown whether Sawyer was displaying symptoms before he flew from Monrovia, Liberia's capital, to Ghana and then to Togo to switch planes to fly to Lagos. His Minnesota-based widow, Decontee Sawyer, told CNN that he had cared for his ill sister in Liberia, though she said he didn't know at the time that his sister had Ebola. When he arrived in Nigeria, he told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone who had the disease. Because it takes between two and 21 days before Ebola symptoms to show, there's little health officials can do to stop an asymptomatic person from flying to another country, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. So, serious viruses such as Ebola may be just ""a plane ride away"" from reaching the developed world, according to Marty Cetron of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mindful of this, Nigeria-based airline companies ASKY and Arik Air suspended operations at the end of July into Monrovia and Freetown, the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. ASKY said passengers departing from Conakry, Guinea, would be screened for signs of the virus. Cetron says it is unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids. Stressing the key role that those working at airports play in keeping Ebola in check, the CDC spokesman said: ""Being educated, knowing the symptoms, recognizing what to do, having a response to protocol, knowing who to call -- those are really, really important parts of the global containment strategies to deal with threats like this."" What else is being done to stop the spread of the disease? Ebola patients are being isolated by health officials in West Africa, and those who have come into contact with them are being told to monitor their temperatures. President Sirleaf has closed most of Liberia's borders with neighboring countries, and the few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers. The President also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five-minute video on Ebola safety. The CDC has issued an alert to health workers in the United States to watch out for any patients who may have recently traveled to West Africa and could have contracted the virus. Why does Ebola generate such fear? Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" ""It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of the people who catch it, causing terror among infected communities,"" it says. The death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 55% because of early treatment. There is also no vaccination against it. Of Ebola's five subtypes, the Zaire strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly. The WHO said preliminary tests on the Ebola virus in Guinea in March suggested that the outbreak there was this strain, though that has not been confirmed. What is Ebola, and what are its symptoms? The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis or even the plague. MSF says some patients may also develop a rash, red eyes, hiccups, chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The early symptoms progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests. How is it treated? There are no specific treatments for Ebola. MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers. ""This consists of hydrating the patient, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections,"" it says. There have been cases of healthcare workers contracting the virus from patients, and the WHO has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus. Carers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose, mouth and eyes. MSF says it contained a 2012 outbreak in Uganda by placing a control area around its treatment center. An outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases. How does it spread? The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, chlorine disinfection, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water. ""People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick: because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient,"" she said.","There are more than 1,300 confirmed and suspected Ebola cases, hundreds of deaths .

The animal appeared badly injured and had her tail tucked between her hind legs, leading the Good Samaritans who found her to believe she was a male. When Eldad Hagar, the co-founder of the animal rescue group Hope for Paws, got the call about the pit bull, he was on his way to save another animal, but made a detour to the park. The rescue team made a touching video showing their efforts to lure the badly injured, rail-thin Savannah from her hiding.

00ef8d03b1e4caa590ac68f43d69cae5dc5733bb,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Most of the Supreme Court justices piled up a lot frequent flyer miles in 2007, jetting to such exotic locales as Austria, India and Hawaii, according to financial disclosure reports released Friday. The U.S. Supreme Court justices at a shoot for their 2006 ""class photo."" And they generally have a good bit of spending money for their travels, based on reported investment income. The records, which were released Friday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, confirm what has been known for some time: that most of the justices are relatively well-off financially. The eight associate justices make $208,100 in annual wages plus income from a variety of resources. Federal judges are not required to publicly release exact income figures, just a general range. The wealthiest justice may be David Souter, with a wise investment he made years ago in a Vermont bank paying off handsomely. His assets in Chittenden Corp. are valued from $5 million to $25 million. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's asset totals are boosted by the fact that her husband, Martin, is a respected private tax attorney in Washington. Justices Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia are also millionaires. Justice Samuel Alito, the newest member of the high court, also reported income ranging from $700,000 to $2 million. In the area of reported gifts, Alito cited about $500 in ""Italian food and wine"" given to him by a friend, about whom the justice helpfully noted it ""is not likely that he will appear before this court."" The latest financial records continue to show Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas reporting assets under $1 million, not including homes and judicial salaries. Thomas received a one-time boost to his income when his best-selling memoir was released in October. He received the remaining half of a reported million-dollar book advance and traveled extensively on a book promotion and signing tour. Scalia also received an advance for his book on how to be a better appellate lawyer. The amount was relatively paltry compared to his colleague's: $33,000. The annual records show that Breyer, Ginsburg, Kennedy and Scalia were the busiest travelers. Each made multiple visits overseas to teach, give speeches or attend judicial seminars. Airfare, lodging and meals were generally paid for by the organizations that invited the justices, but under federal law, they must report it. Europe was a favorite destination for several justices. Breyer reported 21 out-of-town trips for which he was reimbursed, including to Paris, France; Rome, Italy; New Delhi, India; and Palm Springs, California. Ginsburg went overseas to France, Belgium, Ireland and Canada and made at least nine other domestic trips. In the same week in July, Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts were in France and Austria, respectively. But the Most Traveled Award goes to Scalia, who made 33 expense-paid trips, including eight overseas, and visited at least 17 states. Only Souter and Stevens reported no trips for which they were reimbursed by sponsoring groups. Souter also reported no outside teaching gigs, trustee or board memberships, or any gifts received. The 68-year-old bachelor generally spends his extended time away from the high court at his isolated farm in rural New Hampshire. Chief Justice John Roberts may have the most diverse investment portfolio. He recorded 63 investments and trusts, including stock in Time Warner (parent company of CNN), Citicorp, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The estimated value is from about $2.4 million to more than $6 million. Before becoming a federal judge, Roberts was a high-paid Washington lawyer. His judicial salary is $217,400. Roberts, 53, continued to sell off small amounts of common stock, including in Cisco and Citigroup. When he took over as chief justice in 2005, he was forced to sell stock in several companies. A bill passed two years ago in Congress allows federal judges to defer paying capital gains taxes on securities they sell to avoid conflicts of interest. High-level executive branch employees had enjoyed that privilege for years. The issue of judges holding such diverse investment portfolios has resulted in several conflicts of interest, prompting calls for reform. The high court last month refused to accept an appeal from a group of South Africans seeking to sue U.S. and foreign firms for allegedly helping keep the white-led apartheid government of their country in power for decades. Four members of the high court were forced to remove themselves from consideration of the cases. No reason was given for their recusal, but financial disclosure reports showed that Roberts, along with Breyer and Alito, owns stock in several of the companies being sued. Kennedy's son Gregory is a top manager in one, investment bank Credit Suisse. Under federal rules, at least six justices must hear a case that is accepted for review. With four of the nine recused, the high court had no choice but to uphold the lower court ruling, tossing out the lawsuit. Some reform advocates say that judges should be allowed to own only mutual funds instead of individual stocks. Mutual funds involve a range of investments whose identities are disclosed to the fund's shareholders several times each year. Federal law allows judges to own mutual funds without having to recuse themselves from a particular appeal.","Reports show David Souter may be the wealthiest member of Supreme Court .

Former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has said that she believes a woman's place is in the home with her children and her generation of women 'don't need to be feminist'. The 45-year-old, a self-styled champagne socialist famed for her one-time Bohemian lifestyle, waded into the debate about a woman's role in society in an interview for Vogue magazine, with her views sure to outrage feminists. Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy said: 'There are pioneers who opened the breach. 'I'm not at all an active feminist. On the contrary, I'm a bourgeois. I love family life, I love doing the same thing every day.' Before marrying former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, the former singer and model admitted that she found monogamy boring. She had previously been romantically linked with rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton as well as a number of famous politicians and businessmen. However, she soon turned into a conservative wife who shared her husband's right wing views on everything. But she admits that the couple disagree when it comes to gay marriage. She said: 'I'm rather in favour of homosexual marriage and adoption, I've lots of friends - women and men - who are in this situation and I don't see anything unstable or perverse in homo-parental families.' Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy says that her 58-year-old husband is opposed to gay marriage because he 'sees people in groups of thousands rather than as groups of people we know.' She has one child with Mr Sarkozy, a baby girl called Giulia, and an 11-year-old son, Aurelian, from her relationship with the philosophy professor Raphael Enthoven. Her life in the limelight has escalated since Mr Sarkozy lost the May presidential election to his Socialist rival, Francois Hollande. She is currently on billboards all over Paris advertising headphones, is appearing on glossy magazine covers, and has a new album out in February. All of this coincides with Mr Sarkozy being implicated in a number of fraud scandals, including one in which he is accused of illicitly accepting cash in contravention of electoral rules from Lilian Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest women. Conservative: Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy shares many of husband Nicolas Sarkozy's views, but she admits that they disagree when it comes to gay marriage. The pair are pictured together earlier this year . It led to the Paris home Ms Bruni-Sarkozy shares with her husband being raided by police in July, but she refused to be drawn into questions about her husband's legal problems. 'I don't feel like talking about all that, and I won't do any more,' said Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, adding: 'The adventure was fun, but now I want to go back to being an ordinary citizen like everybody else. 'I no longer feel the desire nor the obligation to answer questions about a world that has enriched me humanly, which opened my eyes and mind, but in the end is not mine.' Mr Sarkozy has denied 'taking a penny' from Mrs Bettencourt, but was last week made an assisted witness in a case which could see him end up in a criminal trial.","Carla Bruni-Sarkozy told Vogue magazine that she is not an active feminist .

It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos . An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints . Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children . Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad . Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the . top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in . the watchdog’s annual report published today. In . third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its . controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have . sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old . blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that . revealed her breasts and cleavage. The . broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old . boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped . youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off . The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1.

A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service . 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for $1million. Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a $1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February . In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress. Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog. 'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News. Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement. Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011. In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks.","Charles Hernandez says he was refused service at a KFC in the Bronx last February when he brought in his service dog .

The images are claimed by one Youtuber to be evidence of a UFO landing on the red planet. But, says Nasa, the anomaly can be easily explained as a so-called 'hot pixel' in one of the cameras. Scroll down for video . This image was taken by the Curiosity rover's Navcam Right camera and appears to show a white dot hovering above a mountain on Mars. In reality, according to an Imaging Scientist at Nasa, it is more than likely just a hot pixel, which is an anomaly in the camera that can happen during long exposure pictures . Claims of aliens on Mars are nothing new - many previous supposed sightings have been made. Hot pixels appear in a photograph as bright spots that are out of place when compared to the rest of the image. They are caused by camera sensors getting hot during long exposure images. With regards to the Curiosity rover, they often appear in images taken on Mars. They are also different from 'dead' pixels, which are permanently damaged pixels that receive no power. This latest ‘discovery’ was taking by the two cameras on the mast of the rover, its head and neck, known as Navcam Left and Navcam Right. The images were taken by the rover on 20 June, 665 Martian days since Curiosity first landed on Mars in August 2012. The white light appears to move downwards, suggesting it is moving towards the surface, in two images separated by 31 seconds. In the first image from Navcam Right the white light is above a mountain. But the next image from Navcam Left shows it is closer to the ground. Youtuber UFOvni2012 boldly claims in a video that it is a sign of a UFO arriving on Mars. In the images the light appears to be moving downards, but it's likely just a hot pixel in one 'eye' of the camera and a cosmic ray in the other. The first image (left) was taken by Navcam Right and the second (right) was taken by Navcam Left 31 seconds later on 20 June, a few days before Curiosity celebrated its 'anniversary' But speaking to the Huffington Post, Imaging Scientist Dr Justin Maki from Nasa explained what they thought the anomaly was. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. ‘This is a hot pixel that has been around since we started using the Right Navcam,’ he said. A hot pixel can show up when sensors get hot during long exposures. The reason for a similar white dot in the other image is apparently a coincidence, Nasa tells MailOnline, caused by a cosmic ray or another anomaly. Other ‘lights’ in the past have been attributed to sunlight glinting off rocks or cosmic rays striking the surface. Nasa also points out that these image artifacts, including hot pixels and cosmic rays, are relatively common and can be noticed in many other images taken by Curiosity. Curiosity has been operational on Mars since August 2012 and is now on its way to Mount Sharp. This 'find' came a few days before Curiosity celebrated a Martian year - 687 Earth days - on 24 June, having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once could support life . One infamous false claim of UFOs in the past was the ‘Face on Mars.’ On . 25 July 1976 Nasa’s Viking 1 orbiter released an image of a region . called Cydonia that seemed to show a human face on the Red Planet. In . reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia, . where the human brain picks out faces in an object, in this instance a . chance aligning of shifting sand. In . 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) imaged the region and again . and showed that the sand had continued shifting, erasing the ‘face’ from the surface. In 1976 the Viking 1 orbiter snapped an image of . a region of Mars that looked like a human face (left), leading some to . claim it was a sign of intelligent life, but 30 years later it was . proven to just be a sand dune (right)","Two images seem to show a white dot descending to the surface of Mars .

For generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon. But it seems the latest generation of Monopoly players are simply too busy for the full version of the game. Instead its makers, Hasbro, have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players’ busy schedules. Monopoly Empire is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span . Manufacturers say the new Monopoly Empire game, which is aimed at children of eight and older, is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours. Either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice. In America, makers of the US version . of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they . have even eliminated the jail, so children don’t waste time waiting to . roll a double. And Hasbro aren’t the only ones making their games quicker to play. As . a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call . ‘snack toys’ to appeal to children who have very little play time . because of their action packed days. Toy . manufacturers have been updating other games such as Scrabble and . Boggle with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their . increasingly distracted young customers. How it used to be: Mother and son spending quality time together playing Monopoly - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even 'go to jail' Thanks to its new incarnation as Scrabble Flash, it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, pictured at her home in Harrow. She says: 'The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game' Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of TV. She said: ‘The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game. ‘With many families having both dad and mum out at work all day, evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games. ‘So at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives. However, as society isn’t going to change anytime soon, perhaps it is simple Monopoly being pragmatic. ‘If a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching TV or playing on the computer, then it would be welcomed by many parents.’ And it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with. Last year a joined survey with Netmums and toy manufacturers Mattel questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year. But it’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of Monopoly, in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board. Hasbro, the world’s largest board game maker, has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as Mc Donalds, X-Box and Coca Cola which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of London. Instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board. The winner is the first to complete their skyscraper. Computer games, toys, ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic Monopoly board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens . But Mrs Freegard maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game, it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older. She added: ‘Lots of eight year olds also don’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience. ‘And if they enjoy the short version, it will encourage them to try the longer version, preserving an interest in board games for the next generation.’","Youngsters simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours .

00f5dfb4cafc85b50b652132f460e16b8ba61642,"(CNN) -- Iranian lawmakers have drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported Wednesday. The move comes less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions. ""If the bill is approved, the government will be obliged to complete nuclear infrastructure at Fordo and Natanz (facilities) if sanctions (against Iran) are ratcheted up, new sanctions are imposed, the country's nuclear rights are violated and the Islamic Republic of Iran's peaceful nuclear rights are ignored by members of P5+1,"" state-run Press TV reported lawmaker Seyyed Mehdi Mousavinejad said. The so-called P5+1 is the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany. The draft bill was signed by 100 legislators, Press TV said. A six-month agreement struck in November among the United States, other world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Talks are under way on a permanent agreement, and the outcome is uncertain. The Senate proposal emerged despite Obama administration appeals for Congress to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing. The White House said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and President Barack Obama would veto the legislation if Congress were to approve it now. The proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran's oil exports and other key areas of its economy. Sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord. The Obama administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for Iran to not achieve a nuclear weapon. The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful.

The man behind Apple's maps software has been sacked in a major restructuring of the computer giant's executives after he refused to apologise for its Maps software. Scott Forstall, a long-time lieutenant of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the Apple's much-criticized mapping software, people familiar with the situation said. Sources said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism. Scott Forstall was asked to leave Apple after reports he refused to take responsibility for its map debacle . Instead, CEO Tim Cook signed the letter last month. Forstall will leave the company next year, Apple said in a statement. It also confirmed that John Browett, who was hired as the . company's retail chief just seven months ago after serving as CEO of . U.K. electronics retailer Dixon's, will also leave Apple. The UK executive was Mr Cook's first major appointment and, when his recruitment was announced in January, said that Mr Browett had a commitment to customer service ""'like no one else we've met.' Mr Browett, who relocated to California in April for the job, was awarded a $56m (£36m) 'golden hello' for joining Apple. The payment, due to be made over five years, dwarfed the £1m pay package he collected for running Dixons. His efforts to improve profits at the . stores had alienated employees and sources close to Apple said Cook had . concluded he was simply the wrong person for the job. 'These changes show that Tim Cook is . stamping his authority on the business,' said Ben Wood, analyst with . CCS Insight, said. 'Perhaps disappointed with the Maps issues, Forstall . became the scapegoat.' A retail high-flier credited with reviving the fortunes of PC World and Currys, former Dixons boss John Browett today left the technology giant in a shock exit that comes after he joined in April to head up its global store chain. Mr Browett relocated to California and was reportedly awarded a ""golden hello"" package worth up to 56 million US dollars (£36 million) to drive expansion of Apple's shop portfolio as senior vice president of retail. He was seen as being one of Apple chief executive Tim Cook's key hires and was described by him at the time as having commitment to customer service ""like no one else we've met"". But it is understood Mr Browett, who joined Dixons at the end of 2007 and overhauled the business following a period of under-performance, caused a backlash among employees by trying to cut back hours and staff numbers, before the group quickly reversed the changes. The executive changes are the biggest at Apple in more than a decade, and mark the first major move by Cook to shape his own management team since Jobs' death a year ago. While Apple has enjoyed enormous success since Cook took the helm, recent stumbles including the Maps debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long-term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets. In Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, Apple faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile-computing market. 'Competition is moving much faster to be more Apple-like,' said Tim Bajarin, president of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies. The executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's celebrated industrial design chief, who will now oversee both hardware and software design. Sir Jonathan Ive: The British born designer now oversees the look and feel of Apple's hardware and software . Eddy Cue, a long-serving executive who runs online products, will take charge of Apple Maps and the Siri voice search software. Craig Federighi, who oversees the OSX software that powers the Macintosh computers, will take charge of the iOS software. Putting the mobile and personal . computer software teams together under Federighi could improve . operations within the company, particularly as the capabilities and . features of smartphones and PCs increasingly converge, said analysts. Ive, now responsible for design across . all products, has played a key role in Apple's success by imbuing its . gadgets with a distinct look and feel. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said . Ive could now help reinvigorate the look of Apple's software, which . has been slow to evolve. 'If you have two different heads, you have two different fiefdoms,' he said. The retail stores will report directly to Cook while a search is conducted for a new head of the division. Shares of Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company by market value, have declined 14 percent in the past month since reaching a 52-week high of $705.07 in September. Apple's maps was plagued with problems . People with knowledge of Apple's . inner workings said Scott Forstall's departure was years in the making, and . came to a head with the Apple Maps incident. A 15-year veteran of the company, . Forstall was once considered a possible CEO candidate and is credited . with playing a central role in making the iPhone and the iPad two of the . most successful consumer electronics products ever. But Forstall was also considered a . hard person to work with, and he alienated other senior executives with . his abrasive style, one person familiar with the situation said. This person added that once Jobs passed away, Forstall was left with few defenders at the top of the company. The fate of the executive, who had . 1,000 people directly reporting to him, was sealed by the Maps debacle. Even after a public uproar over the shortcomings and widespread calls . for Apple to revert to Google Maps, Forstall would not acknowledge the . gravity of the problem, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Forstall instead likened the situation . to the complaints over the antenna in an earlier iPhone and insisted it . would blow over without a public mea culpa, the source said. But Cook . disagreed, and issued a public apology with his own signature on it . after Fortstall would not go along, the source added. Apple described Monday's moves as a . way to increase 'collaboration' across its hardware, software and . services business. Forstall will serve as an advisor to Cook until his . departure.","Scott Forstall asked to leave after refusing to take responsibility for maps problems .

00f74207e7a8531be17f38b85eadf4a875467072,"Fracking firms will be allowed to access vast reserves of underground gas without the permission of landowners under controversial laws being drawn up by the Government. Ministers are preparing an overhaul of trespass legislation to make it easier for firms to ignore objections. One source said the reform, which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners, was likely to be included in the Queen’s Speech setting out the Government’s plans for its final year. Anger: Police tackle protesters at Balcombe, West Sussex, who were objecting to a test-drilling site there . Chancellor George Osborne is offering generous tax breaks to kickstart the technology. He believes fracking for shale gas could herald an energy revolution that will boost the economy, make Britain more self-sufficient and put an end to sky-high bills from greedy energy firms. Scientists say the UK is sitting on deposits of enough shale gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years, mirroring the North Sea oil boom of the Seventies. Shale gas development has taken off in the US, using the controversial process of fracking – or hydraulic fracturing. Underground gas deposits are extracted by fracturing shale rock with high-pressure blasts of water, sand and chemicals. Opponents warn that the process risks causing earthquakes, polluting water, blighting the countryside and affecting house prices. Shale gas exploration involves sinking . a vertical well and exploring out from it horizontally, often for more . than a mile. Environmental campaigners and residents have demonstrated . against fracking, clashing with police at well sites such as Balcombe, . West Sussex. Under current . law, firms need permission from owners of land over fracking tunnels. If . the owners object, a developer has to take them to court to overturn . their objections and agree compensation. Resistance: Police get to grips with another group of protesters at Balcombe last summer. The reform, which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners, will make it easier to ignore local objections to drilling . Landowners in the US own any shale gas beneath their land, but in Britain it belongs to the Crown – or, in practice, the Government. Ministers are issuing licences for developers applying to sink exploratory wells. Typically, fracking involves horizontal exploration a mile or more from the central vertical well, meaning many different landowners could be involved. However, laws dating back to the mid-Sixties mean landowners must not withhold permission if drilling under their land is to go ahead. Developers are able to try to overturn any such objection in court, but judges would consider why permission was withheld and whether reasonable efforts have been made to reach an accommodation. They could order compensation be paid even if they overturn an objection and cases can take years to resolve, creating an obstacle to development. Greenpeace has started a campaign to get people in potential fracking sites to register objections to exploration under their land. Landowners in the Sussex Downs National Park, including City fund manager Marcus Adams, plan to use the existing law to block development. Mr Adams said: ‘People across the country have legitimate concerns about the impact of fracking, from water contamination to air and noise pollution. 'But all this happening in a national park just doesn’t bear thinking about.’ The reform of the law would extend the existing rights of water, gas and coal mining firms, set out in the Coal Act 1998, to go under people’s land without permission. Compensation of around £100 is likely to be offered to landowners. The revamp would also apply to the geothermal wells that harness heat from deep in the earth. Developers need to drill on land in urban areas, with one proposed project in Manchester likely to involve exploration under 5,000 homes. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said: ‘Operators prefer to agree through negotiation with the landowner, but there is an existing legal route by which they can apply for access where this can’t be negotiated. We’re considering whether this is fit for purpose.’","Scientists say UK is sitting on enough shale gas for 40 years' supply .

Fugate, who says she was forced to accompany the killer, was found guilty of being an accessory to first-degree murder in connection with the death of 17-year-old victim Robert Jensen. She was sentenced to life but was released after 17 years. Defense attorney John Stevens Berry, who wrote a book earlier this year suggesting Fugate was unfairly convicted, is backing her plea and is hoping the move will become a campaign issue in the Nebraska gubernatorial race, according to the Omaha World Herald. Scroll down for video . Plea: Caril Ann Fugate (pictured left at 15) was on a road trip with  mass murderer Charles Starkweather (then 19) between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Wyoming when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 1958 . Defiance: Fugate (pictured with her late husband Frederick in 2013) has always maintained her innocence and has the backing of several attorneys who say her sentence was unjust . The killings began with the death of 21-year-old Robert Colvert, who was robbed, abducted and shot in late 1957. His body was later discovered on a country road. Two months later authorities found many other bodies including those of Fugate's stepfather Marion Bartlett, 57 and his 35-year-old wife Velda, in an outbuilding. Their two-year-old daughter, Betty Jean, had been clubbed to death with the butt of a gun and her body stuffed in a cardboard box. Fugate admitted taking $4 from Jensen's wallet just before he and a friend, Carol King, 16, were shot to death. One of the main factors in her conviction was that she was holding a shotgun at the time. She was initially sentenced to life, but the term was later reduced to between 30 and 50 years. This meant she was eligible for parole in 1976 and was released after serving 17 years of her sentence because she had been considered a 'model prisoner'. Killer: Starkweather (pictured in a Converse County jail cell) was arrested following the two-month killing spree which lasted between December 1957 and January 1958. He was given the death penalty . Sentence: After serving 17 months in prison, Starkweather was put to death in the electric chair in 1959 after being found guilty of killing Robert Jenson, the only murder he was tried for . In 1996, she asked for a pardon saying the 'sentence did not fit the crime', also telling the newspaper: 'Everyone knows I never killed anyone.' However the request was turned down. Mr Berry, a Lincoln attorney who published The Twelfth Victim earlier this year, claims Starkweather told investigators several times that Fugate was not involved in the slayings . But he changed his story just before they went to trial. Starkweather ultimately testified that Fugate was a willing participant in the murder spree. 'His lies convicted Caril,' Berry told the paper. 'We are convinced not only that she was treated illegally and unjustly, but was, in fact, innocent.' He added that he will survey the candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state — the three offices that comprise the Pardons Board. This is so he can determine where voters stand on the request. Attempts: Fugate (pictured in 1958) was released in 1976 after serving 17 years in prison. In 1996 she asked for a pardon on the grounds the sentence 'did not fit the crime'. Her plea however was rejected . When Fugate was released, she is believed to have moved to Lansing, Michigan, where she worked as a janitor and medical technician. In 2007, Fugate married Fredrick Clair, a machinist who also worked as a weather observer for the National Weather Service. She now lives in Hillsdale, Michigan. Fugate's stepson states she suffered a series of strokes in her late 60s. In August last year, she was critically injured in a car crash in Stryker, Ohio, that killed her husband. Starkweather's murders are the most notorious in Nebraska's history and have been depicted in films and TV programs. The 1973 film Badlands starring Martin Sheen was based on the killing spree.","Caril Ann Fugate, 71, was with Charles Starkweather during the 1957 killing spree that spanned Nebraska and Wyoming .

Few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in Manchester last week. If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously. Instead of looking compassionate, he came across as foolish, opportunistic and embarrassed. Scroll down for video . Founder of the Big Issue John Bird, who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight . Much attention has focused on the reportedly small sum he gave the girl, later identified as a 14-year-old Romanian immigrant. Miliband has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash, as if he were repelled by his own action. Yet that air of self-disgust was appropriate. For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing. The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all. Mr Bird's comments come after Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured dropping money into a beggar's cup outside Manchester Town Hall . It’s a familiar predicament when we’re faced with another desperate-looking figure huddled on the street, palm outstretched. It’s only human to feel that impulse to help — to give a few coins to alleviate another’s misery — and, all too often, for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks: am I really helping? The answer is no. Giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor’s conscience, but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient. On the contrary, it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood, where all self-respect, honesty and hope are lost. Indeed, by reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do. I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life. Growing up in an Irish immigrant family in London with a father who made it his life’s mission to single-handedly prop up the drinks trade, I first experienced homelessness at the age of five, and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage, supplementing my meagre pocket money with what I could get on the streets. Mr Bird says that reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness . Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison. But it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment (begging and rough-sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century). What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose. So, in 1991, I came up with the idea of the Big Issue magazine, a product which people could sell for a decent profit. The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid. Instead of remaining passive, dependent victims, the sellers would become active merchants, gaining discipline, self-worth and honesty. The initiative was widely adopted here and abroad, transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness. I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work. The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster. More than 20 years ago, he was a real hard-case: an alcoholic drug-dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world. Mr Miliband made his donation while walking through Manchester with Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh, left, and Manchester Withington candidate Jeff Smith, right . Thanks to the self-respect the Big Issue gave him, he cleaned up his act, escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult. He is now a Harley Street specialist in drug and drink addictions, helping others to break free as he did. The alternative — embodied in Ed Miliband’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money, only worsens the begging problem. Moreover, such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality, for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws, such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act, but it is often accompanied — as in Mark Dempster’s example — by other law-breaking, like drug possession, theft, disorderly conduct, and even violence. So there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society. Most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction, so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs. Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity. That is why I often say the Big Issue is a also ‘crime reduction initiative’, because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour. This is true even of the large number of Romanians who now sell the Big Issue on British streets; on my estimates, one in five of all Big Issue vendors is East European. Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend. Why on earth are we, a small country with overstretched public services, importing destitution on such a scale from Eastern Europe? The beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old Rebeca State, who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to Romania . That is a question not for the Big Issue organisation, but for the politicians such as Ed Miliband who opened the sluice gates and insisted, for ideological reasons, on open borders within Europe. They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here. At least the Big Issue gives them work, an income, a roof over their heads and a route away from crime. But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses. Unfortunately, thanks to the ill-conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system, some Bulgarians and Romanians have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self-employed status, opening the way to a raft of income-related welfare benefits. That is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who Mr Miliband met in Manchester. Rebeca State, 14, lives with her aunt, Livia Stoica, in rented accommodation; her parents have returned to Romania because of a family illness. As a ‘self-employed’ Big Issue seller six days a week, Ms Stoica can claim £550 a week in welfare. But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack. It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security. This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach. Ms Stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual, but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging. Are social services and the police investigating? If not, why not? And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents? Mr Bird estimates that one in five people selling the Big Issue on the street are of Eastern European decent (file picture) I fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system, which has been ruthlessly exploited by society’s parasites. I have absolutely no time for the pathetic, bleeding-heart mentality so prevalent these days — and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice. I firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported — not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so-called ‘right to a family life’. Indeed, early this year I led calls for the deportation of Razvan Dumitru, a Romanian Big Issue seller based in North London who robbed a blind pensioner of £50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine. For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison. But it is the politicians who created this mess, through their contempt for our borders, reluctance to uphold our laws, and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits. Ed Miliband’s desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour. He should be ashamed of himself.","John Bird co-founder the Big Issue in 1991 after being a beggar himself .

Jesse Ryan Loskarn's body was found on Thursday in his family's Maryland home where he was ordered to stay while out on bail before his trial for the child pornography charges. His mother typed up the note and posted it on a dedicated website in its entirety on Monday night. Loskarn, 35, wrote of 'my deepest, darkest secret' and told how he was abused between the ages of five and nine years old. He went on to explain that because of said abuse, he 'saw' himself in the pictures of the children being sexually abused in the pornography. Beginning of the end: Ryan Loskarn was arrested on December 11 (pictured) and later ordered to live with his parents until his trial. He was found dead by suicide in their home on January 23 . 'It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video. The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection,' he wrote in the note. 'The first time I saw child pornography was during a search for music on a peer-to-peer network. I wasn’t seeking it but I didn’t turn away when I saw it. Until that moment, the only place I’d seen these sorts of images was in my mind.' The note, which was found by Politico, goes on to explain how he fought against his mental troubles for years and told only three people throughout his life of the abuse he allegedly suffered. 'As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse.... In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame,' he wrote. 'As an adult I thought I was a tougher man because of the experience; that I was mentally stronger and less emotional than most. I told myself that I was superior to other people because I had dealt with this thing on my own.' He went on to apologize to groups of people- from his relatives and former colleagues to the children in the videos that he watched. 'I perpetrated your abuse, and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life,' he wrote. His mother, Gay Loskarn, reportedly posted the letter online, and she including a few sentences where she did not defend his actions but placed the blame that he felt over his arrest on the publicity that came with it. New allegations: Loskarn wrote that he was sexually abused as a child and that is what drew him to child porn . 'Our society is quick to judge . especially when the topic surrounding his death is so difficult. This . letter written by Jesse Ryan Loskarn was found after he took his own . life on January 23, 2014. If his words can help just one person who is . suffering in silence it will be his greatest accomplishment,' she wrote. Police . discovered child pornography on Loskarn's hard drive after raiding his . home as part of an investigation of a Canadian filmmaker. Rising star: Loskarn had worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for two years (seen together in January) Loskarn was on conditional release at . the Sykesville home of his parents Chuck and Gay Loskarn, provided he . wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and have no access to the internet. The death was ruled a suicide Friday by the State Medical Examiner's Office. 'The . cause of death was hanging and it was by suicide,' medical examiner's . office spokesperson Bruce Goldfarb confirmed to MailOnline. 'For everyone involved, this is a sad and tragic story from beginning to end,' his former boss Senator Alexander said in a Friday morning statement. Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years up until his arrest. Loskarn's lawyers had successfully argued for his conditional release by saying the 35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and 'deep ties' to the community. Loskarn was arrested last month and faced up to 10 years on possession charges and a minimum of five and maximum of 20 years on distribution charges. According to a filing with the U.S. District Court earlier this month, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the day it was searched, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a window. Stunned and saddened: U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), pictured right, called Ryan Loskarn's (left) troubles 'a sad and tragic story from beginning to end' in a Friday statement .

Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company . whose films feature young nude boys, and discovered the former political . operative made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011. Loskarn . was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to . increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate. Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release the day of the arrest that he was 'stunned, . surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly . departed staffer.

As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse. I did know that I must not tell anyone, ever. Later the memories took on new and more troubling meaning when I became a teenager. They started to appear more often and made me feel increasingly apart from everyone else. In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame. In my life, I had only ever mentioned the abuse to three friends, and then fleetingly so. I never spoke to a mental health professional about this or any other matter until I was in the D.C. jail. I talked with a counselor there about my crime and the horrible hurt I had caused so many people.  I didn’t talk to him about my past. I didn’t think it mattered because I intended to kill myself as soon as possible.In some ways I feel disgusting sharing this truth with you because in my heart I still struggle to see my five-year-old self as a victim. But I’m sharing this with you because it is the truth, not an excuse. And I believe it played a role in my story.To my family, friends and Capitol Hill colleagues:  I’ve had individual conversations with each of you in my mind. I’ve pictured your face as I admitted to my failure and heard the shock and disappointment in your voice. I lay awake at night reviewing these conversations over and over again. They are among the most excruciatingly painful aspects of this terrible, terrible nightmare.And last, to the children in the images: I should have known better.

00fb691a26a54c060cff232a7616723823e95245,"(CNN) -- Former motorsport chief Max Mosley is adamant the re-instated Bahrain Grand Prix will not go ahead because Formula One's 12 teams are unlikely to ratify the decision. The Gulf kingdom was due to host the opening race of the 2011 season in March but it was postponed because of civil unrest in the country. The body that governs F1 -- the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- unanimously decided to reschedule the race for October 30, and move the inaugural Indian Grand Prix to December. But Mosley, a former head of the FIA, told CNN any move to change the racing calendar needs the full support of all 12 teams that compete in the sport, and that there are bound to be objections. Bahrain's F1 race rescheduled for October . Mosley told CNN: ""I'd be astonished if it happened. I think the decision was the wrong one and I think it is bound to be reversed. I don't think there's any chance there will be a Bahrain Grand Prix on October 30 and I think its most unlikely there will be one this year. Webber: F1 wrong to reinstate Bahrain . ""When you're going to change something in the middle of the season, like the proposal to move the Indian race for example, that needs the unanimous agreement of all the teams. I don't think there's the slightest chance of that actually being given. ""The teams have complete power in this particular case because although the governing body can cancel an event for reason of force majeure - as happened in the case of Bahrain -- when you want to put an event on or move an event, that's a change to the conditions under which the teams entered for the season and that's like any contract -- you can only change it if both sides agree. ""All 12 teams would have to agree to change the Indian date and go back to Bahrain, so it only takes one team to say 'I don't agree' and that'll be the end of it. It would not be possible for it to happen."" FIA president Jean Todt and vice-president Carlos Garcia visited Bahrain before announcing their decision, but it drew criticism from The Bahrain Center for Human Rights and current Red Bull driver Mark Webber. The Australian said he thought going back to Bahrain would only cause more tension. ""Like it or not, F1 and sport in general isn't above having a social responsibility and conscience,"" he told his personal web site. Mosley said there would be no long term damage done to Formula One if the move was swiftly scrapped. If it wasn't, protests could ensue, he suggested. ""I think if it gets reversed quickly and people understand what is going on in Bahrain and act accordingly, I don't think it will do any damage at all, it will just show a mistake was made that was quickly put right,"" he told CNN. ""If F1 were to persist in the idea of having a race in October I think it would do enormous damage because I think there would be protests at European and other races, some of the sponsors would come under pressure from their customers and therefore put the teams under pressure. ""I think it would be very difficult to predict how far it would go. On top of that I think there's a high likelihood, I think Mark Webber's right, you'd have some really unfortunate incident when the race took place. Happily, I think that's academic. ""It would be contrary to the rules, contrary to article 66 of the international sporting code, it would, apart from any other consideration, send a completely wrong message about what F1 is there for and what our sport is all about."" Mosley even suggested next year's race in Bahrain could be in jeopardy if problems persist. Next year: ""They must be given a chance but I don't think anybody would want to go there when people are in prison without trial, when doctors and nurses have been arrested simply for treating injured people,"" he said. ""All of those things are very disagreeable. We have to wait and see how things develop and not pre-judge it.""","Max Mosley tells CNN the re-instated Bahrain Grand Prix is unlikely to go ahead .

Prosecution: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin and the Trust has now admitted breaking the law . A scandal-plagued hospital trust has today admitted breaching health and safety law after a  a patient died when nurses failed to notice she was severely diabetic and needed insulin. The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the safety of Gillian Astbury, yet no staff will face the consequences in the courts. The 66-year-old lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated at Stafford Hospital in April 2007. The NHS trust was prosecuted as an . organisation, meaning that individual nurses, doctors and managers will . not face jail for their failings. Today it has pleaded guilty through its barrister to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act by failing to properly manage and organise hospital services, including its systems for record-keeping, patient information and communication between staff members. Hundreds . of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire . between 2005 and 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned . that many others had suffered inhumane abuse. Gillian . Astbury was admitted to Stafford Hospital following a fall at home. She was put under the care of a . team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed . to realise she was diabetic and needed regular doses of insulin. She . fell into a coma and died ten days after first being admitted on to the . ward. Her friend and carer, . Ron Street, said that when he went to visit her she was often in soiled . bed linen and her meals would be left out of reach. Deaths: Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at Stafford Hospital - the worst scandal in NHS history . The . HSE began investigating the death in April, having postponed its probe . until after the publication in February of a major report following a . public inquiry into the scandal. Families of the Stafford Hospital victims and union chiefs called for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign . It concluded that there was . enough evidence to charge the trust under the Health and Safety at Work . Act, for failing to protect others against risks to health and safety. The criminal prosecution at Stafford Magistrates' Court was brought by the Health and Safety Executive three years after an inquest jury ruled that Mrs Astbury's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and a systemic failure to provide adequate nursing facilities. The trust could now be fined tens of thousands of pounds. The . HSE said it was not the first time a hospital trust had been prosecuted . under the law but there have been only a handful of cases. Although . the proceedings were not being brought against individuals, two of the . nurses involved face being struck off following professional hearings. In July the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled that Jeanette Coulson and . Ann King had failed to keep Mrs Astbury’s records up to date or carry . out blood tests.

00fc56b8beb41ffede1b319b184b751bb2873ce8,"Beijing (CNN) -- Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child. But she's also found a way of making it pay. After noticing she produces more than she needs, Yan -- who lives with her five-month-old baby in Shenyang, the capital of China's northern Liaoning Province -- decided to sell it. ""I don't want to waste my milk,"" she told CNN. ""I heard that others sell breast milk online, and I thought 'Why not sell mine?' I created a Web page and started my business."" A cursory search for ""breast milk"" on 58.com, a Chinese online shopping platform, reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk. From Shanghai to Guangzhou, nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade. ""I just need to wait for calls,"" said Yan. ""I provide fresh and frozen breast milk. But you have to pick it up yourself."" According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply. In contrast, a month's worth of conventional baby formula costs around 2,000 RMB (US$325) in China. After China's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas â€” most notably in Hong Kong. However, earlier this year Hong Kong introduced limits on the amount of milk powder travelers can take out of the territory, over concerns about shortages and a ""black market"" in formula sold at vastly inflated prices. The restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies. ""If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powder,"" explained Fang Lu, a newlywed who is planning to start a family. This week, the mistrust of milk powder extended to the biggest single supplier of dairy products to China. On Saturday, New Zealand company Fonterra announced that a strain of bacteria that causes botulism had been found in batches of an ingredient used to make baby formula, as well as sports drinks. China immediately halted imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, and increased inspections of New Zealand dairy products. Some mothers may be turning to others' breast milk as an ""safer"" alternative but health experts say it doesn't come without risks. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, babies fed unscreened milk from other mothers could be exposed to infectious diseases, including HIV, and illegal and prescription drugs. It adds that, if not stored properly human milk, ""like any type of any type of milk, becomes contaminated and unsafe to drink."" In May, China opened its first breast milk bank at the Guangzhou Maternity and Childcare Hospital and just last week another opened in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. However, like others around the world, they impose strict controls on who is able to donate, limiting the availability of supply. The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China. A number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers. Separately, an increasing number of women are turning to informal milk sharing sites that trust donors to properly store their milk and declare any lifestyle or health risks to prospective recipients. On those sites, the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited. In China, trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area. While the Ministry of Health Law Supervisor Department has declared that human breast milk cannot be a commodity, no laws regulate or explicitly prohibit its sale. But while the practice may not be encountering legal obstacles, some people spoken to by CNN expressed discomfort with the growing popularity of the trade. Wangyan Liu, a doctor from Beijing, said he was concerned about breast milk sales, saying that poorly stored milk could make infants sick. ""If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous,"" he said. ""We need laws for the breast milk business."" But for Yan, the emergence of China's breast milk market is a positive development -- and not one that is solely motivated by profit. ""I think the business is totally fine. I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money,"" she said.","Some mothers in China have begun selling their excess breast milk online .

Turkish police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters who tried to enter an Istanbul park at the centre of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government. Hundreds of people were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday organised by the Taksim Solidarity group of political parties and non-governmental organisations.

A Turkish riot police officer uses tear gas to disperse protestors during an anti-government protest near Taksim Square in Istanbul . Police intervened with a water cannon to break up a crowd of several thousand marching along Istanbul's main pedestrian shopping street towards Taksim Square where the park is located before firing tear gas to break up smaller pockets of protesters. After a police crackdown on a small demonstration on May 31, the Gezi Park protests grew into broader action against what critics see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian style of government. The unrest died down in late June but on Saturday police went in to disperse protesters who wanted to march on Taksim Square. Erdogan has pressed for significant reforms in the economy and curtailed the power of the military which toppled four governments in four decades. Turkish riot police use a water cannon to disperse protestors near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey . Opponents argue that during the June unrest he appealed increasingly to Islamist elements of his AK Party faithful. Hours before Monday's police intervention, Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu spoke enthusiastically about the park's reopening. 'We have seen with the visit carried out today that all our work has been completed,' Mutlu told reporters in the park, which has been spruced up with the planting of new trees, plants and lawns since the protesters were evicted on June 15. 'People became brothers here, and it will be very crowded tonight because we all missed that brotherhood. This park will always be the symbol of people's unity, power and harmony,' university student Ozer Sari, 22, told Reuters. However, 54-year-old Abdullah Dogan dismissed the idea that the protests were about protecting the park.

Taksim Solidarity, which is opposed to the construction of a replica Ottoman era barracks on the site, had called on Sunday for its supporters to hold a public meeting. A police official told Reuters they evacuated the park because there were illegal groups inside who planned protests. Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last month's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical Association. The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner pressed Turkey on Monday to investigate reports police used excessive force to contain the protests and punish anyone found guilty. An elderly man sits on the marbles of Gezi Park next to a cordon which reads 'Police - No entry' A Turkish court has cancelled the Taksim Square redevelopment project, including the construction of the replica barracks, although the authorities can appeal against the ruling. The ruling marked a victory for the coalition against the project and a blow for Erdogan, who stood firm against protests and riots he said were stoked by terrorists and looters. Erdogan has said he would wait for the judicial process to be completed before proceeding with the Taksim plans, one of several large projects for Istanbul, including a major airport, a large Mosque and a canal to ease Bosphorus traffic. If Turkey's top administrative court rules in favour of the development on appeal, Erdogan has still pledged to hold a referendum in Istanbul on the government's plan but he will drop the project if the court rejects it.","People were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday over plans to redevelop the area .

00fcb94b937a62afc6d4b8efac3828dbc1c78549,"(CNN) -- The wife of the president of Oral Roberts University is denying allegations of improper behavior, saying the claims ""sicken"" her. Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last week. Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her ""sicken me to my soul. ... I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply."" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a ""convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students"" while the man acted as a ""mentor."" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site. The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled ""Scandal Vulnerability Assessment."" It says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the president's residence and that she ""spent the night in the ORU guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions."" It also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car, time-stamped after midnight, despite a citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors not with their parents. The suit does not allege sexual behavior. The suit says Richard Roberts ""sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence,"" and ""a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position."" In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit. ""The part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they don't even know if these allegations are true,"" she said. ""I believe it's grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which I am not even named as a party."" Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence. It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school ""to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university."" The man had previously ""confessed to crimes"" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says. ""In one of these convictions, this 'Mentor' for ORU students -- reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction, and under the direct supervision of President Richard Roberts -- confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room,"" the suit says. It also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on October 2, the board allowed ORU and Roberts to fire the school's financial comptroller after 26 years of service. Within hours, ""voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence,"" according to witnesses, the suit says. Beyond the online posting, university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday by CNN. The suit was filed by John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker, who accuse Richard and Lindsay Roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account, using them for home renovations, expensive vacations and clothes -- allegations the Robertses and the school have previously denied. After complaining to the school's Board of Regents about university spending, two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions ""so intolerable"" that he had no choice but to resign, the lawsuit says. One of the firings, the suit says, was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost, who is named as a defendant. The suit calls for actual damages ""in excess of $10,000"" and punitive damages also ""in excess of $10,000"" for each plaintiff, as well as attorneys' fees, court costs, ""and any further relief that the court deems just an equitable."" In an interview last week on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" before the latest allegations were added to the suit, Richard Roberts called it ""the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed in my life."" Asked whether someone is out to get him, he responded, ""It sure seems that way."" Lindsay Roberts called the allegations ""preposterous."" The three plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit, meanwhile, accuse school officials of making libelous public remarks about them in an effort to discredit the lawsuit. Last week, before the amended suit was filed, the board vowed to hire an auditor to look into ""allegations made in regards to Oral Roberts University and certain members of the administration,"" board Chairman George Pearsons said in an October 7 statement posted on the ORU Web site. ""The Oral Roberts University Board of Regents is committed to operating the institution in accordance with all ethical, legal and moral standards.""

00fe9bc7ef1fa3e5d4dd7f09871e7165ace17aaf,"You may not have noticed how tricky it is to snap a single strand of dried spaghetti in half, but the phenomenon has baffled leading physicists for decades - including a Nobel Prize winner. But now one engineer has filmed spaghetti fracturing at 250,000 frames per second (fps) to explain why this happens. The YouTube star found that vibrations do not cause the spaghetti to shatter - as previously suggested. Instead, as it tries to ‘straighten itself out,’ the pasta forms cascading fractures and rapidly breaks into multiple pieces as its bent. Scroll down for video . Break point: An engineer has filmed strands of spaghetti being snapped at 250,000 frames per second (pictured) in order to explain why it doesn't ever snap in two halves, when it's bent from the tips. It seems that the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting of the pasta . This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent. If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ. On his YouTube channel, Smarter Every Day, Destin Sandlin set out to explore why a single strand of spaghetti doesn’t break in half, but instead shatters into at least three pieces when bent from the tips. Generally, rods - such as a pencil - eventually break into two if they are bent. This happens when the top of the rod exceeds the maximum allowable tensile stress, which is the state of stress that leads to expansion. When a piece of spaghetti was bent to breaking point, and the process was filmed at 250,000 frames per second, it was revealed that smaller broken pieces of pasta rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti moves 'downwards'. Engineer Destin Sandlin explained that the spaghetti strand is trying to straighten itself out, because it twists when it is bent into a curve. When a first break occurs, the piece that breaks off from the main strand untwists, but the remaining longer section is more twisted than before, triggering one or more fractures - causing it to break into more than three pieces. ‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,' he explained. So the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting . This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent. If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ. But spaghetti’s unusual shattering process has stumped scientists for years, including Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynmann, who worked on the Manhattan Project. If you snap a strand of spaghetti, you feel a tiny vibration on your finger as it curves, leading Dr Feynmann to suggest the vibration may 'excite' the spaghetti enough to cause a secondary fracture. This means that he thought an elevation in energy levels at a molecular or atomic level was to blame. But, upon testing this theory under water to dampen the vibration, the spaghetti still broke in the same way - discounting this theory. Since his efforts, some physicists and mathematicians have worked to solve the mystery. In 2006, two physicists from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, won the Ig Nobel Prize for Physics for their work in explaining spaghetti shattering. They applied a mathematical calculation called the Kirchoff equation, which explains how waves travel through an object that's under stress. The physicists found that that spaghetti fragmentation is caused by 'flexural waves' (bending waves) traveling through the pasta after the first break. This causes a wave to travel down the remaining strand of spaghetti before it can relax and un-twist. Mr Sandlin began filming pasta snapping at 18,000 fps using a high-speed camera to test the theory, but at this speed, both fractures seemed to happen simultaneously within a millisecond, giving him few clues. Destin Sandlin (in the video) noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally, appears to break downwards, after he flexed a strand to break it . At 40,000 fps - 10 times faster than previous research - it was possible to see which fracture occurred first in a ‘snap,’ leading him to say: ‘It appears that the longer rods aren’t vibrating on the same timescale.' He noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally, appears to break downwards. 'It's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out but it can't overcome its own mass,’ he explained in the video. He found that a strand of spaghetti twists as it is bent, making it bend into a deep curve. ‘When a break occurs, the piece near the side near the break is free from torque,’ Mr Sandlin said, which means, it is no longer twisted. ‘It starts to straighten itself out from left to right, rotating up and straightening out along the way.’ In the video, the longer piece of spaghetti which is yet to break, is still curved and twisted and at the point that the first fracture occurred, the spaghetti is even more curved than it was before, causing another fracture almost immediately. ‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,’ he said. So the fracturing is similar to a chain reaction of destructive untwisting, which leaves the spaghetti broken into pieces instead of snapping in two. His video confirms the work by the physicists at Marie Curie University.","Destin Sandlin filmed spaghetti snapping at 250,000 frames per second .

Carol Veitch, 45, was bitten more than a year ago. But the agony she is in means giving her five-year-old son Paul a goodbye cuddle before school is impossible. While she had no fear of spiders before, she is now too scared to leave the house, and says her newly developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Scroll down for video . Carol Veitch, 45, from Harrogate, suffered a horrific reaction after being bitten by a false widow spider a year ago. She has been left in too much pain to hug her children . Mrs Veitch, pictured here with husband Richard, 51 and son Paul, now 5, before the false widow bite. She wasn't scared of spiders before but has developed arachnophobia so severe she can't leave the house . Mrs Veitch suffered a horrific reaction to the bite, which caused hundreds of sores to appear all over her body . Two days after the bite her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she had flu-like symptoms, and then over the following eight weeks sores and swelling developed over her body . Mrs Veitch was cleaning her home in Harrogate, which she shares with husband Richard, 51, when she felt a bite on her ankle. Unable to find the culprit, or a visible mark, she thought her skin must be becoming irritated by the hot summer weather. But two days later her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she was exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Mrs Veitch said: 'I was coughing and couldn't breathe. I went to the doctor and he told me that I had a chest infection and bronchitis. 'While there I got him to check my leg. I was in a terrible state so they put me on steroids.' Just days after she first visited her GP in Harrogate, Mrs Veitch found the false widow spider trapped in her bath tub. She said: 'I took the spider to the doctor and we got it identified by the local environmental health department. The doctor said my symptoms were typical of a false widow bite.' 'The doctor was shocked because none had been sighted in Harrogate at the time - the nearest case had been in Manchester.' The false widow spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom . False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. The chances of being bitten by a false widow are incredibly low, with no more than 10 spider bites being reported each year in the UK, according to animal experts. Over the following eight weeks Mrs Veitch's condition became worse, with sores and swelling developing across her arms and face. Despite treatment with medication, the sores are still so painful that direct physical contact leaves her in agony. Mrs Veitch said: 'I would love to give Paul a cuddle before he heads off to school, but I can't, because my skin is too sore. 'I can't face going swimming with my kids because it looks like I have leprosy. 'If I was stood next to someone who looked like me I would be terrified. 'I can't go out or show my arms because it's  embarrassing. 'My face has changed because it swelled up so much. I'm completely covered in sores.' Mrs Veitch had no fear of spiders before she was bitten but is now so scared of them that she is afraid to leave the house. She said her newly-developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. She said: 'I can't sleep because I'm terrified one will come into the bedroom. 'We found a common house spider in the living room last week and I didn't sleep for two nights. 'If I see one on television I'll have a huge panic attack and leave the room crying.' Mrs Veitch's husband, Richard, 51, has taken time off from his job as a construction foreman to care for his wife. She said: 'It's had a massive effect on my marriage because I used to be so independent and now I rely on him for so much - but he's been brilliant.' Mrs Veitch, who has three sons - Pail, five, Nathan, 23, and Jamie, 26, and a daughter named Amber, 15, now attends regular therapy sessions to help her overcome her new-found fear. She said Paul has also developed arachnophobia due to being traumatised by his mother's illness. Mrs Veitch said: 'I've terrified him. If he's in the car with his dad and he sees even a tiny spider he will go hysterical. 'I can't even cuddle him to make it better. 'If he see's anything move he'll jump to attention and try to protect me. He's so brave. 'If he sees a creepy-crawly he will yell to me 'don't look' until Richard has moved it away.' Mrs Veitch said the bites have affected her family. She is now very reliant on her husband and can't hug her children before they go to school . British homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months, according to experts. That’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits. And it could mean we’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months. The mild summer has meant the eight-legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished. With temperatures set to fall, experts from Sydney University have said the larger-than-usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate. Professor Adam Hart, of the University of Gloucestershire, agreed with their predication and said: ‘This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it’s quite mild out there.’ Both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females. Mr Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Society told MailOnline that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside, with males hunting for females. But he agrees that the particularly mild summer we’ve had, not too hot and not too cold, will have given spiders access to more prey.","Carol Veitch, 45 was bitten by a false widow spider more than a year ago .

Mandy Ashforth, 48, and Barrie Moat, 50, both from Rotherham, South Yorkshire met on holiday in Bridlington and were inseparable - until a week later a 19-year-old Barrie failed to turn up for a date with Mandy, leaving her alone at a bus station. He didn't have her home phone number or address so he couldn't contact her. Mandy, who first met Barrie in 1982, aged 17, said: 'We spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the Sunday. Together after 30 years: Barrie Moat, 50, and Mandy Ashforth, 48, are to walk down the aisle 31 years after they first met . 'I arrived to meet Baz in Rotherham bus station and waited two hours but he never came and I was devastated. 'In the year that followed, I looked for Barrie Moat in various places in Sheffield but never found him. 'The months turned into years and Barrie was always in my mind. 'I searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end.' Mandy spent 30 years looking for Barrie and finally managed to track him down on Facebook.But when he accepted her friend request it was because he thought she was interested in his fishing business. Barrie, . who lives in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, said: 'I have no idea why I . didn't turn up to meet her - I really can't remember.

Stood up: Rotherham bus station, as it is today, where Mandy waited for two hours for Barrie - to no avail . 'I only joined Facebook to promote my fishing pole repair business and I never normally accept friend requests from women unless they have something to do with fishing. 'For some reason I assumed she was involved with fishing so I clicked to accept it and within seconds she had sent me a message. 'Things very quickly just clicked into place and we both decided we wanted to be together. Aisle be yours: the pair are set to wed next summer . 'It was just too good to be true. We both knew we had met the right person - I only wish I'd known that 30 years ago.' Mandy couldn't believe her luck when she finally found Barrie online. She said: 'I searched and there he was, that cheeky face which I recognised straight away.' 'I couldn't believe it was my childhood sweetheart - I sent him a friend request and he accepted. 'He said later he wouldn't normally accept a request out of the blue but it must have been meant to be. 'We started texting and messaging each other and the bond between us became stronger each day, and our love grew stronger as each day passed by. 'We eventually decided it was time to meet up after over 30 years apart and it was the scariest thing I have ever done.' Barrie proposed to Mandy 18 months after she first found him online and now the couple are looking forward to their wedding next summer. Mandy, who has five children from a previous marriage, said: 'As soon as I saw Barrie, I knew from that moment all my hopes and dreams had come true. 'I don't know why Barrie didn't turn up at the bus station back then and he can't remember why, either.

Since war broke out in Syria nearly four years ago, America has welcomed 524 people from the rapidly disintegrating country with open arms. U.S. intelligence agencies lack the resources to vet them properly, but the Obama administration plans to admit a few thousand more this year. 'The United States has admitted 524 Syrians since 2011,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Feb. 13. 'We're likely to admit 1,000 to 2,000 Syrian refugees for permanent resettlement in Fiscal Year 2015 and a somewhat higher number, though still in the low thousands, in Fiscal Year 2016.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday that the US has already admitted 524 refugees into the United States from Syria, where intelligence about their links to terror groups like ISIS is hard to come by . Kurdish refugees have streamed across the border with Turkey since the bloody civil war broke out in Syria in 2011 . House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Rep Michael McCaul (right) called it a 'huge mistake' to resettle more Syrians in the United States . Assistant Secretary of State Anne Richard said in December that the State Department already had about 9,000 Syrian cases on its agenda, and receives 'roughly a thousand new ones each month.' The Department of Homeland Security ultimately makes the decisions. The idea that Islamist terrorists could use America's generous asylum system to bring their Holy War to the U.S. has set off a frenzy of complaints that the U.S. lacks the ability and resources to properly screen every Syrian who seeks safe haven from the Bashar al-Assad regime. 'It's clearly a population of concern,' National Counterterrorism Center director Nicholas Rasmussen told the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11. FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach said Friday that there's a lack of reliable information on the ground about the Syrians applying to get into the US . Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican, replied that it would be a 'huge mistake' to resettle more Syrians in the U.S. United Nations estimates suggest that as many as 4 million people have already fled Syria; another 7 million remain in the country but have been forced to leave their homes. The ISIS army, a self-proclaimed 'Islamic State,' is based in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Its reign of brutality has included mass executions, countless war crimes and the routine sexual abuse of women taken as 'wives' from conquered territory in Syria and Iraq. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price told Reuters in January that screening protocols for refugees 'are rigorous, . continually refined, and build on years of experience vetting . individuals coming to the United States from around the world.' 'They permit us to proceed in a . way that seeks to both safeguard public safety and serve our . mission of providing refuge to some of the world's most . vulnerable people.' But vetting is only possible if intelligence agencies have reliable information about the petitioners, who are usually referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. America has received hundres of refugees like these people fleeing to Lebanon . Syrian refugees are 'clearly a population of concern,' National Counterterrorism Center director Nicholas Rasmussen told the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11 . FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach told the Homeland Security panel that unlike cases in Iraq, where the U.S. has had a presence for more than a decade, Syrians' applications are rarely accompanied by robust information about the petitioners. There's 'a lack of information' about many of them, Steinbach admitted. 'The difference is, in Iraq we were there on the ground collecting [intelligence], so we had databases to use.' But 'the lack of our footprint on the ground in Syria,' he said, means that 'the databases won't have the information we need. You are talking about a country that is a failed state, that does not have any infrastructure so to speak.' 'So all the data sets, the police, the intel services, that you would normally go to and seek that information, don’t exist.'","Members of Congress are suggesting it's unwise to let Syrians into the country, but 524 have come in already .

The human rights group says that while labor camps are being shut, research suggested that authorities are expanding the use of ""black jails,"" enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and ""brainwashing centers"" to take their place. ""There is a very real risk that the Chinese authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of other types,"" the report said. A spokesman from China's Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the Amnesty report. Corinna-Barbara Francis, Amnesty International's China researcher, said the abolishment may only be a ""cosmetic change just to avert the public outcry over the abusive re-education through labor system."" China said on November 15 that it would close its labor camps after earlier putting the policy under review, with the move hailed as the biggest change to China's criminal justice system in decades. Detention without trial . The system was set up in 1950s and allows police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves, prostitutes and drug addicts -- for up to four years without a trial. According to China's Ministry of Justice, the country had 351 labor camps at the end of 2012, with more than 50,000 inmates. Other estimates have put the number of detainees much higher. The ""re-education process"" has also been used to punish those detained for their political, religious or personal beliefs -- such as members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or petitioners with complaints against local officials, Amnesty said. Torture is said to be rife at the camps. Detainees have told Amnesty International they were beaten, sometimes with electric batons, denied food, subjected to simulated drowning, injected with unknown drugs and subjected to the ""rack"" torture."" Brainwashing centers . The report said interviews with petitioners and Falun Gong practitioners revealed abuses were continuing despite the closure of the camps. Some labor camps were being re-labeled as drug rehabilitation centers and released detainees were being sent to black jails -- unofficial detention centers set up in places like hotels or abandoned buildings -- or ""brainwashing centers,"" another form of arbitrary detention. Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Zhi told Amnesty International she was released from a labor camp in Harbin in June 2013 but on her release staff from a brainwashing center were waiting for her at the gate. Her family were able to intervene and prevented her from being taken away. She has since gone into hiding. ""The Chinese authorities must immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention and ensure that laws protecting detainees are brought into line with international human rights standards,"" Francis said. ""This needs to be a fundamental change in the policies that are at the root of the repression and which strip detainees of their most basic rights.""","Amnesty says China's move to abolish labor camps may be a cosmetic change .

The actress was bombarded with angry comments after she used Twitter to advertise her controversial collection, which includes skimpy designs aimed at under-eights. The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted ‘kids should look like kids’. Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children's bikinis - with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls . The 49-year-old used her personal Twitter account to ask her 450,000 followers: ‘Going somewhere hot at Easter? Check out our Swim Collection.’ She then added: ‘Our Kids collection is divine too.’ Miss Hurley then added a picture of the kids bikinis on display in Harrods, before uploading a link to her website where the items are sold. However, one follower, Lee-Anne Compton wrote back: ‘I’m all for kids looking fab, but looking like kids and safe in the sun.’ EM Grant then posted the message: ‘KIDS? Leopard Print bikinis on KIDS!?’ Julia Hall then wrote in disbelief: ‘What ages are the kids!?’ The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted 'kids should look like kids' The actress’s website features several children wearing the skimpy designs while striking poses more suitable for adult models. It includes items for the under eights, such as an animal-print ‘Mini Cha Cha Bikini’ which costs £32.90 and is modelled by a blonde child with both hands placed precociously on her hips. Another design, called the ‘Collette Bikini’ is advertised in the 8-13 age range, and is described as being ‘great for girls who want to look grown up’. Campaigners have previously hit out at Miss Hurley’s bikini collection, calling them ‘disturbing’. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute charity, said the designs put pressure on parents by attracting young girls to the notion of growing up too fast. She says: ‘Parents have been telling us for a long time that they want their children to be able to enjoy childhood. We’d like young girls to be encouraged to emulate Olympic stars like Ellie Simmonds and Rebecca Adlington when in the swimming pool - not models in leopard print.’ In a report in 2011, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, set out a series of guidelines to be met in order to prevent the sexualisation of young children. One of the recommendations was for ‘retailers to offer more age-appropriate clothes for children and sign up to a code of practice which checks and challenges the design, buying display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children’. A spokesman for Miss Hurley has previously defended the designs saying they are hugely popular with parents and children. It was last year that Gwyneth Paltrow was also accused of sexualising children after endorsing a range of bikinis for girls as young as four, and which she was selling through her lifestyle website, GOOP. The website says the design is perfect for little girls who want to match their mothers, as the top is an exact copy of the adult version - also sold on the website.","Two years after she was accused of sexualising children with designs .

Dangerous games: Sgt Matthew Gallagher, 22, died of a gunshot to the head on an army base in Iraq . A soldier, who died after a colleague allegedly shot him at point-blank range during a game of 'quick draw', was warned not to play the game two days before. Sergeant Matthew Gallagher, 22, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head while serving at his base in Al-Kut, Iraq on June 26 last year. Sgt Brent McBride, 25, was initially charged with murder over the death of Sgt Gallagher from Falmouth, Massachussetts. However following a hearing in Texas last month no further legal proceedings were set for McBride, an army source told msnbc.com, but the military would carry out its own investigation. Sgt Gallagher's widow Katie, 23, and his mother Cheryl Ruggiero spoke for the first time this week to the Boston Globe about the investigation in December - and had many unanswered questions. In the weeks following his death, his wife . and mother came to believe he had died in action. Reports from the investigation in Texas . last month said that Sgt Gallagher pointed his gun at Sgt McBride, saying: 'What would you do now?' It is then believed that McBride drew his own gun and pointed it at Gallagher’s head before firing the fatal shot. The lawyer for McBride said at the time . it was a 'tragic accident', and he did not know the 9mm pistol came to be loaded, . according to the Cape Cod Times. Mrs Ruggerio, 53, who is suspicious of McBride's account, told the Boston Globe: 'He did take someone’s life. You can say . it was a horrible accident, but he knew, as a soldier, with his . training, it’s not something you do. You don’t pick up a gun and put it . to someone’s head.’ Demanding answers: Sgt Gallagher's widow, Katie, 23, and mother Cheryl Ruggiero, from Falmouth, Massachussets still have questions about their loved one's death . McBride was initially charged with . murder but an Army spokesman at Fort Hood, Texas, told msnbc.com that no . further legal proceedings are set 'pending a review' by the Army. It is . not clear whether the soldier will be court-martialled. Sources said that several soldiers and at least one higher-ranking staff sergeant warned them against playing the game.

Hair straighteners are causing 'horrific injuries' to hundreds of young children across the UK, a safety charity has warned. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said at one hospital in Northern Ireland, one in 10 of children admitted with burns, had been injured by the beauty device with some needing plastic surgery. Hair straighteners can reach scorching temperatures of 220C - hot enough to fry an egg. As they take 40 minutes to cool they remain dangerously hot for far longer than many parents realise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hair straighteners reach temperatures of 200C and most commonly cause hand injuries among children . Youngsters who grab or fall on them can suffer disfiguring injuries as their skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults. Figures released by the Royal Belfast for Sick Children show that 17 children aged between three months and nine years attended A&E at the hospital in 2009-10 with hair straightener burns. The average age of the patient was just 18months. They represented nine per cent of the 187 children who attended with 'thermal injuries' during that year. In June this year, the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol revealed is had . treated 110 children for serious burns in the last five years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents have urged parents to remember the three S's... SWITCH hair . straighteners off and unplug them straight away . SLIDE them into a . heat resistant bag . STORE them out of the sight and reach of children . They add to take care not to burn yourself when using straighteners by making sure you don't place them too close to your scalp or ears. Across the UK this would add up to hundreds of serious injuries every year, with thousands more receiving minor injuries. Children are most likely to receive burns to their hands, however children have also sustained injuries to the head, arm and foot. Nicola Vance, a mother from Belfast, . revealed her 19-month old toddler was injured after falling onto her . straighteners a year ago just after she had switched them off. Although . she whisked him away, just a couple of seconds did serious damage. She said: 'Alfie has just learned to . shuffle so he was moving along the bed, he caught himself in the sheets . and just fell forward onto the straighteners. 'The . middle of his eyebrows was all red and his skin had melted. If the . straighteners had been any hotter, they would have peeled off his . forehead. 'Alfie was lucky that he didn't lose his eyes, although he has been scarred for life.' Now RoSPA are working with the . Belfast Health and Social Care Trust on a 'Too Hot to Handle Campaign' to raise awareness of the risks. Alfie Vance received facial burns after he fell onto his mother's straighteners . Sheila Merrill, RoSPA’s public health . adviser, said: 'The campaign in Northern Ireland builds on other . awareness-raising work that RoSPA has been carrying out across the UK. 'We . know from reports and from talking to the people who work in A&E . that burns from hair straighteners is a significant issue and a national . problem. 'And yet the . risks posed are so easy to reduce. Simply by putting these devices into . heat resistant bags after use, and storing them in a place that’s out of . the sight and reach of children, we can go a long way to preventing the . kind of burns which can scar for life.' The campaign has created a video to show just how hot straighteners can become. Dr Julie-Ann Maney, consultant . in paediatric emergency medicine at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick . Children, said: 'Hair straightener burns are preventable. The Too Hot to . Handle campaign will highlight how dangerous these devices are, . particularly to small children and that the public need to be aware of . the horrific injuries that can be sustained.' Phil Buckle, director general at the . Electrical Safety Council, said: “The ESC is delighted to support the . Too Hot to Handle campaign. 'Our grants funding schemes mean that we can . work with organisations like RoSPA Northern Ireland to raise awareness . of electrical dangers in the home and to change people’s behaviour so . that they act more responsibly around electricity.

010498738c0d529311486c5fc25eb938c5e29d02,"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans offered their own proposal Monday in the heated battle to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but it was quickly rebuffed by President Barack Obama's administration for not demanding more from the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. The GOP plan promises $2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, including $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. House Speaker John Boehner called it a ""credible plan that deserves serious consideration by the White House."" The move follows spitting back and forth in recent weeks, with each side claiming the other isn't sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January, a scenario many economists say would hurt the U.S. economy. Senior Obama administration officials slammed the Republican plan, calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it isn't serious enough. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers . White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized it for not meeting ""the test of balance."" Another Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, earlier said the president ""will not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2%,"" as the GOP proposal would do. ""Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won't be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,"" Pfeiffer said. Republicans make budget counter-offer . Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010. In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign, Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a $4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. In addition to adding a $50 billion stimulus package, his proposal closes loopholes, limits deductions, raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love . Yet Republicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Their plan offered Monday proposed $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes. The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010. ""This is by no means an adequate long-term solution, as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform,"" the letter said. ""Indeed, the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect, but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs."" GOP, break Grover Norquist's grip on you . In his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal ""includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve."" ""Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires,"" he said. And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal, saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but ""circumstances have changed since then."" ""It is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today,"" Bowles said. Recent posturing on both sides -- such as Boehner saying this weekend he was ""flabbergasted"" by Obama's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction. 5 ways you would stop the fiscal cliff . In 2011, Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling, a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade. The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis, which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week, 56% of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people, while 36% said taxes should be kept low to create jobs. Listen: WWJD...about taxes? Another survey, by ABC News and the Washington Post, showed two thirds of respondents support Obama's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans. So what happens next? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP's plan was a nonstarter, primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2% income bracket and was too short on specifics. But even with no more offers officially in the works, both sides will keep talking, the officials said. That may happen as soon as Monday night, when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to, among others, the president himself. Defense companies see cuts coming even with a budget deal . CNN's Ashley Killough, Adam Levy, Deirdre Walsh and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","House GOP leaders call for some revenue increases, more spending cuts .

010551dc8450fd90aee7b9b10541e230e493156a,"(CNN) -- In 1834, Illinois voted whether to adopt Christmas as a legal holiday. Among those voting ""nay"" was the young Abraham Lincoln. In 1834, Lincoln had not yet grown out of his atheist phase, but the young Lincoln's lack of faith in God -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of Christ -- does not explain his vote. In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote. Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834. Lincoln marked his first Christmas as President, in December 1861, by holding a Cabinet meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening. The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards. Nobody was much shocked by these omissions. The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century. George Washington issued a proclamation on Thanksgiving, but he never made any statement about Christmas (or Easter for that matter). The first state to recognize Christmas as a holiday was Alabama, in 1836, but the North and especially New England resisted. Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday. The federal government took until 1870 to follow. There's debate on the point, but it seems that Benjamin Harrison was the first president to allow a Christmas tree inside the White House in 1889. The tradition of lighting a tree on the White House grounds commenced with Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards. Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly ""seasonal."" It waited until John F. Kennedy in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene. This late flowering of Christmas observance reflects two facts about Christmas that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the ""war on Christmas."" In its first century, the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything Americans would accept today. One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays. As evangelical forms of Christianity spread after 1800, the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the Sabbath. Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations. In response, Congress voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on Sunday, on pain of losing their positions. The Americans of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious, but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious. Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences. Calvinists and Baptists, Methodists and Catholics, the grandest Boston rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed, sometimes to the point of outright violence. Anti-Catholic riots ripped apart Boston, Philadelphia and Bath, Maine, between the 1830s and 1850s. These contending denominations could, however, agree at least that they did not want a remote government in Washington favoring some religious practices over others. Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath. Better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them. A second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to Christianity: the keen awareness of many 19th century Christians of the non-Christian origins of many Christmas traditions. Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia. Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition. The Christmas tree, the hanging of wreaths and house-to-house caroling hark back to the pre-Christian German holiday of Yule. Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century. But many Protestant denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century. Two changes made possible the coalescing of an official Christmas holiday over the 40 years from Calvin Coolidge's outdoor Christmas tree to John F. Kennedy's sacral Christmas card: The fading of distinctions between Christians and the decline of theology within Christianity. The once all-crucial distinctions between Calvinists and Arminians (whose beliefs came from Dutch reformist Jacobus Arminius) and between even Protestants and Catholics have blurred. The once-vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished, as American Christianity evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did. If Christians decorate trees, then tree decorating must be Christian -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it. Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course. Surrounding them, however, is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway. For them, a Christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity. Many Americans feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years. When they champion ""Christmas as it was,"" they do not mean ""Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln"" and much less ""Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards."" They mean, ""Christmas as it was when I was young."" That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus. If your Christmas celebrates the appearance of God Himself in the form of a human baby, it won't have a lot of room for a gift-giving elf and flying reindeer. But if Santa is at most tangential to the Christmas of faith, he is utterly central to the Christmas of folkway. It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about ""the war on Christmas."" The Christmas of Santa and Rudolph, and trees and stockings, and candy canes and ""Merry Christmas"" greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the United States only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Lincoln, like many in 1834, didn't observe Christmas as an official holiday .

01076dbd82d585bc868a3d0eb08a1f280d73f088,"(CNN) -- The ""conservagencia"" is starting to give Jon Huntsman a second look. He deserves it. But the stirrings of respect may be too little, too late. Too bad, because he might stand the best chance of beating President Barack Obama. RINO hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the Republican Party. And so when Jon Huntsman entered the presidential race, the impulse was to smack him on style points as a Republican in Name Only. It made some sense on the surface -- after all, he was the former Obama ambassador to China, in addition to being the conservative former governor of Utah. At a time when tea party enthusiasm tended toward the hot, Huntsman was cool, promising a campaign of civility and ideas. He seemed to be courting independents and centrists at the outset of the GOP primary, openly dissing the anti-intellectualism of conservative populist candidates such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann. In one infamous tweet, he pined: ""I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy."" All this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times. And so his actual record as governor and his policy plans as candidate were overlooked. Forget the record of cutting taxes, reforming government, improving the business climate and balancing the budget. Forget that he was the one candidate with real-world foreign policy experience. He was an apostate in a cult-like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty. No one was happier than the White House, which was apparently most worried about running against Huntsman (""I think our guys were worried about Huntsman. I think he was the one who people were most worried about"" recounted one Obama aide in Politico writer Mike Allen's and author Evan Thomas' new e-book, ""The Right Fights Back""). So Huntsman had the buzz but no support -- he seemed stuck in the low single digits and even would-be supporters shrugged their shoulders. It seemed to say more about the current makeup of the Republican Party than it did about Jon Huntsman. After all, he was the first candidate to embrace U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's plan for deficit reduction. His jobs plan was touted by The Wall Street Journal in uncommon terms: ""Mr. Huntsman's proposal is as impressive as any to date in the GOP Presidential field, and certainly better than what we've seen from the front-runners."" He even had the guts to proclaim a determination to end the collusion and market distortion of ""Too Big to Fail""-- a cause that could unite Tea Partiers and Occupy protesters. But even though 70% of Republican primary voters say that economic issues are their primary focus, Huntsman's conservative substance could not seem to override the centrist style: He would not pander or throw radioactive red meat. Even the statistical analysis by the fivethirtyeight blog at The New York Times, which found Huntsman would have the best chance of actually beating Obama in the 2012 general election, did not seem to change hearts and minds. But as the revolving door of not-Romneys spun faster and faster, spitting out candidates from Bachmann and Perry to Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, a desperate search for an electable conservative alternative to Romney commenced. And now, all of a sudden, the Utah governor has started to get some respect. CNN contributor Will Cain was an early advocate of Huntsman's substantive record as a conservative, in contrast to the style he evinced at the start of his campaign. ""In this Republican primary, a candidate's conservativeness seems to be measured by his venom toward Barack Obama,"" Cain wrote in The Blaze. ""And I'm afraid we've elevated style to such a degree that it's clouding our view of what is conservative."" RedState.org editor and CNN contributor Erik Erickson is another unexpected voice lately arguing that Huntsman might just be the real conservative in the race: ""His record as a governor is more conservative than Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney combined. He is more pro-life than either of them. He is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them. He has better foreign policy experience than either of them. Huntsman should be a conservative hero in this race."" Conservative wise man George Will even seems to be making the case in comments delivered on the ""Laura Ingraham Show,"" saying: ""I think if you look at Jon Huntsman's record, what he's laid out, his proposals for taxes and the economy, his opposition to No Child Left Behind, you could make a case that he deserves a searching second look from conservatives. Huntsman's position on foreign policy is the most conservative. That is, it is the most modest in assessing the need and ability of the United States to control distant events."" Jon Huntsman is putting all his chips on New Hampshire, where he's been inching forward in the polls. Unlike the Iowa caucus, it's a state with an open primary where independents can vote and a principled center-right perspective might be rewarded. Tonight he will get a chance to shine in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate with Gingrich in New Hampshire. It might prove to be a highlight of the 2012 campaign -- a substantive and civil debate about ideas, providing more light than heat. As conservatives consider the choice between the two flawed front-runners, Gingrich and Romney, they might reconsider the wisdom of purging center-right candidates like Jon Huntsman on matters of style versus substance. In the process, they just might finally find the perfect marriage of ideology and electability for which they have been looking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon says some conservatives are starting to give Jon Huntsman another look .

01078a3dcdde35c465c741ac95f10323c6068ff6,"(CNN) -- The Constitution says that only ""natural born citizens"" are eligible to be president. Is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas eligible, given that he was born in Canada of a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban immigrant father? If Cruz runs, 2016 will be the third consecutive election in which there were questions about the right of a major party candidate to serve. Unfortunately, the Framers left few clues about exactly what a ""natural born citizen"" is; Congress has not used the phrase in citizenship statutes since 1790. Indeed, the phrase is so obscure that it has been called the Constitution's worst provision by the dean of the Yale Law School. But it is likely that Cruz is a natural born citizen, because he was a citizen by birth. In any event, even if there were some question, the courts are unlikely to interfere with the decisions of the electorate about who we want as our president. We have clear rules for who is a citizen by birth, and who can become a citizen after birth by naturalization, but neither the Constitution nor laws passed by Congress define ""natural born citizen."" The phrase comes from the English common law, which defined the term as including anyone who, by natural law, owed duties to, and was protected by, the monarch. The sovereign expected obedience from anyone born in the country, other than the child of a foreign diplomat or an enemy soldier. So children born in England, even to parents who were not English themselves, were natural born subjects. As such they were obligated to pay taxes, say, or perform military service, and they had the rights of English people. The word ""natural"" was critical. English courts found that some people were naturally subjects if born in the dominion of the sovereign even if Parliament had passed no law making them such. Simply being born naturally created rights and duties. Politics: Who is eligible to run for president? The United States had natural citizenship in this same sense; white people born in the United States were always regarded as citizens, even before the Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1868, put that principle in the Constitution and extended it to African-Americans. Clearly, those born in the United States are eligible to be president; if they are not, no one is. There is also wide agreement that people who became citizens after birth, such as former governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer Granholm, cannot run. Naturalized citizens are ineligible, no matter how able and popular, no matter how loyal and integrated into American society. The question about eligibility has always been with regard to children of U.S. citizens born overseas, like Ted Cruz, and Republican presidential candidates John McCain and George Romney before him. The Supreme Court has held that foreign-born children are U.S. citizens only to the extent that a law passed by Congress makes them so. As the child of a U.S. citizen mother, Ted Cruz was born a citizen by virtue of the Immigration and Nationality Act. But did that make him a natural born citizen? The United States has citizens, not subjects; we are a nation of free people, not ruled by a hereditary sovereign. Therefore, the English concept does not translate directly to the American context. Instead, the question is who is a natural member of the political community. Most immigration and citizenship scholars, including me, believe that the answer is that any person who is a U.S. citizen at birth is naturally a part of the political community and hence eligible to be president. (I argued that John McCain was not eligible, because the statute granting citizenship to people born in the Canal Zone was passed only after he was born; since he was not a citizen at birth, he could not be a natural born citizen.) There is a far-fetched counterargument, that only those who have citizenship by natural right, those born in the United States -- and perhaps only white people born in the United States -- are truly natural-born because only they are citizens without some law like the Immigration and Nationality Act or a constitutional amendment like the Fourteenth Amendment making them so. All others, who are granted citizenship because of some action by Congress, are mere naturalized citizens. This argument seems wrong to most scholars. But whatever its merits, it is not likely to be tested in court. Judges appropriately hesitate to overrule the democratic process. If Cruz runs and is challenged, the courts will almost certainly rule that a random voter has no standing to challenge his candidacy. Other candidates are not likely to sue, but rather will focus on trying to win the election. Judges will recognize that, at bottom, it is hard to find a legitimate reason that Ted Cruz or any other person in his situation should be denied the presidency if the people of the United States want him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin.","Sen. Ted Cruz was born in Canada of a U.S. citizen mother and Cuban immigrant father .

01092242ce7fd97dc2acde70ce9fe8b708f67e05,"(CNN) -- Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj arrived home in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum early Friday after nearly six years in the U.S. Navy prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj at a hospital in Khartoum after his release from Guantanamo Bay. ""I was so happy that I cried,"" al-Hajj told the Qatar-based Arabic news network by phone from his hospital room, where he was taken after arriving at the airport. ""It is our right to be happy and to rejoice, but we also miss our brothers that we left behind and who live in very difficult conditions."" An official with the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer brought to an end a matter that the United States and Sudan considered to be ""of great mutual concern."" Al-Hajj, a Sudanese citizen in his late 30s, was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by Pakistani intelligence officers and handed over to the United States, which accused him of being an ""enemy combatant."" A senior Pentagon official confirmed the journalist's release. Al-Hajj was held without being charged or given a trial, Al-Jazeera reported. The cameraman was on a legitimate assignment and carried a work visa at the time of his capture, the network said. It also reported that the U.S. plane that carried al-Hajj had about 20 other former detainees aboard who also had been released from Guantanamo Bay. The plane dropped off a Moroccan national, identified as Al-Saeed Bou Jaadiya, the network said. Al-Jazeera aired video showing a bearded al-Hajj being carried from the plane in Khartoum by U.S. military personnel and laid on a stretcher. He was transported to Al-Amal Hospital. ""He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher,"" said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital. ""He was exhausted and very sick, and he's receiving the necessary care in the hospital."" Khanfar said he was awaiting word from doctors on his medical condition. In a statement, U.S. Charge D'Affaires Alberto Fernandez of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer ""is a result of many factors and the work of many hands. An important one was the cooperation between the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Intelligence and Security Service."" Al-Hajj had been on a hunger strike for more than a year and was being force-fed, said Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer who has worked on al-Hajj's case since August 2005 and last visited him three weeks ago. ""Al-Hajj is remarkably thin,"" Katznelson said. ""He looks like an ill man."" The journalist was conscious, but did not appear to speak to anyone as paramedics rolled his stretcher inside. Family members stooped to kiss him as the gurney passed. ""I would have hoped they were here with me now. I look forward to the moment,"" al-Hajj said told Al-Jazeera before being reunited with his family. Earlier, al-Hajj's wife spoke to the network about his release. ""Now I can think differently,"" Asma Ismailov said. ""Now I can plan my life differently. Everything will be all right, God willing."" Al-Hajj's young son, Mohammed, said he would ""kiss his head"" when he sees his father. ""I'll tell him that I love him and I need him."" The Sudanese government told Al-Jazeera that al-Hajj faced no charges in Sudan and is a free man. The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj's release, including one that prevents him from any political activity. Reporters Without Borders, which campaigned for al-Hajj's release, said in a statement that the cameraman ""never should have been held so long."" ""U.S. authorities never proved that he had been involved in any kind of criminal activity,"" the worldwide press freedom group said. The organization said al-Hajj was accused of gun-smuggling for al Qaeda and running an Islamist Web site, although no evidence supporting those charges was produced. ""We are delighted that Sami al-Hajj can finally be reunited with his family and friends,"" said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""But his detention for six years, without the most basic due process, is a grave injustice and represents a threat to all journalists working in conflict areas.""

010c1ef212f56f27b86fd0d5d1b40d98748396b0,"(CNN)  -- Defending champion  Serena Williams will miss the Australian Open in January to give herself more time to recover from foot surgery. The former world number one has not played competitively since winning her fourth Wimbledon crown in July. She sustained the original injury after standing on broken glass at a restaurant shortly after winning her second grand slam of the year and 13th of her glittering career. Williams attempted to come back ahead of the season-ending WTA Championships in Qatar, but had to abandon her attempts after aggravating the injury in training. The American was also due to compete in the Hopman Cup in Australia next month, but in a statement released Thursday said she had been left with no choice but to pull out. She said: ""As I continue to rehabilitate my foot after the second surgery last month, it is with the utmost regret that I am withdrawing from the Hopman Cup and the 2011 Australian Open Championships. ""As I recently learned, pushing myself back into my intense training too early only caused me further injury and damage. ""While I desperately want to be back on the court and competing in the first grand slam tournament of the year, it is imperative for my health that I continue to work with my doctors to ensure my foot heals properly."" Williams dominated the early part of the 2010 season, with victories at the Australian Open and the grass of Wimbledon, but in her absence Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark claimed top spot in the global rankings. Belgian rival Kim Clijsters also claimed the final grand slam of the season at the U.S. Open and the WTA Championships, making her a warm favorite for the Australian Open which kicks off the 2011 season, particularly with Williams sidelined. Williams promised her fans to ""be back better than ever as soon as I can be.""","Defending champion Serena Williams pulls out of Australian Open .

Britain is ready for a gay Prime Minister, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have claimed. The Lib Dem and Labour leaders said social attitudes had changed dramatically in the last 20 years. Voters would judge a potential prime minister on their ability to lead rather than their sexuality, they said. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg (left) said voters would judge a leader on their ability not their sexuality and Labour leader Ed Miliband said he expects there to be a gay PM . Senior politicians from all parties were challenged over the politics of sexuality as gay marriage became law in England and Wales last night. The first ceremonies are due to take place on March 29. Asked whether the public would accept a gay PM, Mr Clegg told GT magazine: ‘Yes and why not? ‘Being gay doesn't affect how you work, how you interact with people or how you make decisions. I'm confident that the British people would judge him or her on their ability to lead and be a good prime minister and not on who they choose to share their life with.’ Mr Clegg said he hoped in the future children would not dread coming out to their parents. He added: ‘I would have no issues at all if one of my boys told me that he liked another boy. ‘It's not a choice, it's who you are and I would love my boys regardless of their sexuality. ‘I just hope that some day coming out to your parents is not going to be something you dread but something you will remember fondly.’ Mr Miliband said he expects there to be a gay PM in the future as social attitudes have driven a series of changes, including equal marriage, in the last 20 years. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains . The Labour leader said: ‘Yes. I think the world has changed a lot. ‘If you think about the way the world has changed in the last 20 years since I was at college we've seen the repeal of Section 28, we've seen civil partnerships, the lowering of the age of consent, equal marriage and that has been driven by change in social attitudes and that is why I think absolutely it's foreseeable to have a gay prime minister. ‘The most important thing to me is that my kids are happy and I don't care whether they're gay or straight. That's what matters to me.’ To date there have been no openly gay leaders of any of the main political parties in Westminster. Ruth Davidson, Tory leader in Scotland, is the first out female leader of a major party in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said ‘sexual orientation should be neither here nor there’ as people are helped to achieve their full potential - including becoming PM. He added that more role models - either straight or gay - were needed to encourage best behaviour in sport, adding clubs ‘must tackle problems on the terraces’. In an open letter, Mr Cameron said he was proud to be PM of a country judged to be the ‘best place to live in Europe if you are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans(gender)’, adding the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains. On sport, the Conservative went on: ‘We are working to break down barriers in sport, too. People should be able to excel in sport regardless of their sexuality - but we know how hard it's been. ‘We have seen the enormously positive reaction to people like Thomas Hitzlsperger and Gareth Thomas being open about their sexuality, and hopefully that will encourage others to be more open too. ‘But we need more role models, straight and gay, to encourage the best behaviour and clubs must tackle problems on the terraces.’","Lib Dem Nick Clegg says being gay doesn't affect how you work .

010cd75a5b587285f7697cdb6db6526bcc0320b2,"(CNN) -- Police said Tuesday they are looking for a woman in connection to a fatal shooting and crash on the Las Vegas Strip that left three people dead. They are calling 22-year-old Tineesha Lashun Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso, a ""person of interest."" ""She's not considered a suspect,"" said Laura Meltzer, a spokeswoman with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. ""She's somebody detectives would like to speak to in connection with this event."" Police say Howard has been identified as being inside a black Range Rover at the time shots were fired from the vehicle. She was described by police as 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing around 120 pounds and having green eyes and dark hair. She is listed as a missing and possibly endangered person from the Miami area. ""This case needs to be solved,"" Meltzer said, urging Howard to come forward. Police had previously identified Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, as a suspect in the shooting. He is at large, though a black Range Rover police say he was driving early Thursday morning has been impounded. Police consider Harris to be armed and dangerous and say he has an extensive criminal history, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. He has several tattoos, including a small heart -shaped one below his right eye and a large one of an owl that covers his neck and part of his chest. A woman who said she is Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have been girlfriend and boyfriend for about a year. Miladys Garcia said she recognized Harris from an image that police issued but that she knew him by a different name. Garcia said she hasn't been in contact with her daughter since the shooting. She provided CNN with a phone number for Howard, who she said was 21 years old, not 22. A call Tuesday went straight to voice mail, and the mailbox was full. Police have released several photographs of Howard and Harris. They pose together in some; one is identical to the Facebook profile picture of a woman identified as ""Yeni Alfonso."" That page says she is from Naranja, Florida, attended Homestead High School in Homestead, Florida, works as an entertainer at Playmates Cabaret and lives in Las Vegas. A man identified as Emilio Alfonso has posted two messages on her page since Sunday. ""Yeny, call me now,"" read one in Spanish. ""You've got me worried. Call me. You are very important. Everything has a solution,"" read the other, also in Spanish. In the shooting and crash, Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati around 4:20 a.m. Thursday when someone in a Range Rover shot at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. Cherry, who was shot in the chest and arm, later died at a hospital. The Maserati continued into the intersection with Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU said. A passenger in the taxi -- identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Maple Valley, Washington -- also died. Her death and the deaths of Boldon and Cherry have been ruled homicides, according to the coroner's office. The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Police say they want to talk to Tineesha Lashun Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso .

010d464b7a2a3d0beb1c064a1a1a0c3c583aece1,"A father has attacked a court's decision to fine him more than £400 for taking his daughter out of school to go to her grandmother's funeral - despite the fact she missed 40 days of term-time. Ikram Hussain, 51, took his daughter Imaan out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to attend his 86-year-old mother Gulab Bi's funeral in Pakistan. However, he was hauled before magistrates after his daughter, who was aged five at the time, failed to return to classes for more than a month. Ikram Hussain, 51, took his daughter Imaan (pictured) out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, to attend his 86-year-old mother Gulab Bi's funeral in Pakistan and kept her off school for 40 days . Mr Hussain's mother died on March 3 and he said he joined his wife Humaira, 31, the following day in attending the school to inform them of their plans to attend the funeral abroad. However, the taxi driver said the couple were told they would be fined if they proceeded as intended because they wanted their daughter, who is now six, to have a lengthy period off school because the funeral service included 40 days of prayer. The father of four said it is part of Muslim tradition to take 40 days of mourning following a relatives death. He said he travelled to the country, with his wife and daughter, to bury his mother's body immediately after her death and stayed for a further 40 days while the community helped the family mourn. He said that, as part of the tradition, friends and family members would visit the family during the 40-day period before they all attended a service on the last day to say the final prayers to the deceased. He is now angry at a court's decision to fine him after he took his daughter out of school on March 4 and didn't send her back to classes until April 9. Mr Hussain was fined more than £400 after taking his daughter out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire (pictured) on March 4 and not sending her back to classes until April 9 . Last week, Mr Hussain appeared alongside his wife at Kirklees Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty to the offence. The couple were fined £416 including court costs after an original fine for keeping their daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment. Under new measures brought in last year, parents can now be fined for taking their children out of school during term-time. Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year. However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'. Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, can face a fine of up to £60 for every child. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail. Mr Hussain, of Paddock, Huddersfield, disputes the court's decision and said he wanted the court case to go to trial because he wanted a jury to 'hear what he had to say'. He said: 'At the time I was not really bothered but I am annoyed about it now. It's not as if it was a pleasant trip for us to make. 'I had no other choice but to take my daughter with me to do the burial.  It’s something we had to do. 'The magistrates were not interested in what I had to say. I wanted a jury to hear what I had to say but it seems that's not possible.' Gill Ellis, assistant director for learning and skills at the school, said: 'The law makes it clear that head teachers can only grant leave of absence during term time for exceptional reasons. 'It is at the discretion of the head teacher to decide what is exceptional and how many days a child can be away from school if leave is granted. 'If a parent decides to take the child out of school without the head teacher's permission then they will have 21 days from the day the fine is issued before it doubles. 'If after 28 days the fine remains unpaid then the council will normally proceed with prosecution. Mr Hussain, 51, who appeared alongside his wife Humaira, 31, at Kirklees Magistrates' Court (pictured) was fined £416 after an original fine for keeping his daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment . 'The court then determines whether the parents are guilty of an offence. Parents are advised of the process when they make the initial leave request. 'We are committed to providing the best start in life for our young people, in schools. 'Therefore, every lesson of every day is important and absence from school can be very damaging to a child's education. 'We have an excellent record in Kirklees of reducing absence from school and overwhelmingly it is the case that parents are very supportive of the measures taken locally to promote attendance at school.' The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer faced a fine and potential prison sentence in August after allowing her daughter to skip seven days of school. Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups and between January and March this year Miss Capper kept her at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. Kerry Capper, 25, (left) was hauled before a court after letting her seven-year-old daughter Libby (right), who is recovering from cancer, have the odd day off school to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill . However, the mother was summoned to appear before magistrates for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’. Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates last month for failing to pay the £60 penalty fine, which was later increased to £120. Birmingham Council said no reason was given for the time off and that Ms Capper had failed to attend meetings arranged by the school to discuss the situation. However, the unemployed mother was cleared by the bench who said that while magistrates felt Ms Capper was in breach of the school's truancy policy processes she was 'not necessarily in breach of the law'. Earlier this year, parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter warning them about their three children missing class after they took them off school for a week for their grandfather's funeral. Parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter after they took their three children (pictured together above) out of school for a week to attend a funeral service in Cumbria earlier this year . The children, Teagan, nine, Isla, five and Elsie-Mae, three, travelled with their parents and eight-month-old brother Noah from their home in Sheffield to Cumbria for the funeral service. The Catholic funeral service stretched over two days, meaning the three youngsters missed a week of school. Mr and Mrs Overend-Hogg said they were 'disgusted' by the letter that awaited their return. Officials in Ballifield Primary School in Sheffield said the absence was 'unsanctioned' and as a result could  jeopardise the children's place in the school. And in May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of school for her grandfather’s funeral. Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.","Ikram Hussain angry at court decision to fine him over £400 for absence .

010e9046b8bf3d817e91bbe817bed854b630b1f8,"Queiroz was Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2 at Manchester United . By . Joe Bernstein . Carlos Queiroz quit as manager of Iran on Wednesday night after a Bosnian side inspired by Edin Dzeko ended their hope of progressing into the knockout stages of the World  Cup. Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko ensured already-eliminated Bosnia secured the first World Cup victory in their history by scoring the opening goal and setting up a second for Roma's Miralem Pjanic in Salvador. Iran fought back to score their first goal of the tournament through Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad but Bosnia quickly restored their two-goal advantage with a fine effort from Avdija Vršajevic to leave Queiroz's side bottom of Group F. Sir Alex Ferguson's former No 2 at Manchester United confirmed afterwards his stint in Tehran was over after three years. Gone: Iran coach Carlos Queiroz quit his role after their defeat by Bosnia and Herzegovina in Salvador . Heated: Former Manchester United No 2 Queiroz says he'll always have Iran football in his heart . Lonely job: Queiroz kicks a water bottle after Bosnia midfielder Miralem Pjanic put his side ahead 2-0 . He said: 'I've shown my commitment to this project, but I haven't received any new contract offer. 'It's been an honour for me to work for Iran, I've fallen in love with the country. But you can't have a marriage when only one side wants to commit. 'I waited for them to make an offer, but I haven't received anything, so today I've come here to say 'thank you' to those who gave me the opportunity to do this job. 'I will always have Iranian football, my players and the fans in my heart.' Bosnia didn't want to end their debut World Cup without a point after narrow losses to Argentina and Nigeria. Dzeko had seen a goal wrongly disallowed and also missed several chances in that game so he was relieved to shoot Bosnia ahead after 23 minutes with a left-footed strike outside the area. Deadlock broken: Edin Dzeko is muted in his celebration after opening the scoring for Bosnia and Herzegovina . Precision: The Manchester City striker put his nation in the lead with a sublime left-footed strike . Out of reach: Iran goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi is given no chance as Dzeko's shot goes in off the post . Finally: Dzeko scored with his 12th shot of the tournament after Bosnia's losses to Argentina and Nigeria . Rain on his parade: Queiroz said he hadn't been offered a new contract by Iran football . For once, he was left free by white-shirted defenders and took full advantage with a clinical finish that clipped off the inside of the post. Iran have been one of the best teams in Brazil in terms of defensive organisation but toothless up front which cost them in a 1-0 defeat against Argentina when Lionel Messi scored late on. The irony yesterday was that when they tried to push forward seeking the win to take them into the last 16, Jalal Hosseini needlessly gave the ball away and Dzeko reacted quickly to play in Pjanic to score. Ghoochannej finished smartly from six yards after good work from Javad Nekounam down the left to briefly give Iran some hope. Slotted: Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic takes his chance to put Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-0 up against Iran . Cool and calm: Pjanic shoots as Bosnia go 2-0 up at Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador . Despair: Iran's Andranik Teymourian covers his face as Iran's chances of advancing evaporate . But that evaporated 120 seconds later when the overlapping Vršajevic fired in his first international goal from a tight angle to atone for an earlier miss he'd made from Dzeko's through-ball. An emotional Queiroz added: 'We pushed ourselves to the limit, mentally and physically and I'm very, very proud of them. Despite all our difficulties, we kept pushing and created some good chances, but Bosnia-Herzegovina were better today.' Bosnia's win was a great source of pride. A new nation of just four million people, their real victory was to reach the finals having overcome a war in the 1990s that killed 200,000 people. Even so, their goal celebrations were subdued as if they realised they should have probably been in the last 16 themselves. Back in it: Iran were given a glimmer of hope for Reza Ghoochannejhad finished on the far post . Broken down: The Charlton striker scored Iran's first goal of the tournament past Stoke's Asimir Begovic . Get on with it: Javad Nekounam grabs the ball quickly for the restart as Iran chased a victory . Back of the net: Ghoochannejhad's celebration is muted as Iran still need to score two goals to progress . Dzeko was criticised for wastefulness against Nigeria but he blamed the New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary for Bosnia losing that key game. Even so, several of their players will have enhanced their reputations in South America including £15million-rated Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Meanwhile, Iran will lament a lack of firewpower up front. With a World Cup record of one win in 12 - against the USA in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability. Salvador  maintained its reputation as the Brazilian venue for goals - four matches there have yielded 21.

Saudi Arabia's status as one of Washington's most important Arab allies has at times appeared to trump US concerns about the terrorist funding that flows from the kingdom and about human rights abuses. But Obama said he has found it most effective to apply steady pressure over human rights 'even as we are getting business done that needs to get done.' 'Sometimes we need to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns we have in terms of counterterrorism or dealing with regional stability,' Obama said in a CNN interview that aired in advance of Obama's arrival. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama cut short his trip to India to fly to Riyadh on Tuesday to pay his respects following the death of King Abdullah and meet his successor, King Salman . First Lady Michelle Obama covered up her arms for the officials meeting with leaders of Saudi Arabia, one of the most repressive nations in the world when it comes to women's rights . Obama was greeted at Air Force One by new Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz . The Obamas were greeted by an armed Saudi honor guard and a military band playing the national anthems for both the US and Saudi Arabia . Stepping off the plane in Riyadh, the president and First Lady Michelle Obama were greeted by new King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud and a military band playing both countries' national anthems. Some of the all-male Saudi delegation shook hands with Mrs Obama while others gave her a nod as they passed by. Mrs Obama wore full-length clothing but no headscarf, as is typical for many Western women in Saudi Arabia, despite the strict dress code for Saudi women appearing in public. Salman formally greeted the U.S. delegation soon after at the Erga Palace on the outskirts of Riyadh, where dozens of Saudi officials filed through a marble-walled room to greet the Americans under massive crystal chandeliers. After dinner at the palace, Obama was to hold his first formal meeting with Salman before his four-hour trip came to an end. Ahead of his arrival, Obama suggested that he would not be raising U.S. concerns about Saudi Arabia's flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, who was convicted of insulting Islam and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. His first flogging took place in early January in front of dozens of people in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, though a second round has been postponed after a doctor said his wounds from the first lashes had not yet healed. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama stand with new Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz they arrive on Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was among the American delegation that welcomed the rule of King Salman, half-brother of King Abdullah . Secretary of State John Kerry (right) was also on hand to pay his respects to King Salman and offer condolences about his half-brother . 'On this visit, obviously a lot of this is just paying respects to King Abdullah, who in his own fashion presented some modest reform efforts within the kingdom,' Obama said. Obama cut short the final day of his trip to India to make the four-hour stop in Riyadh. Further underscoring the key role Saudi Arabia has long played in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East was the extensive delegation that joined Obama for the visit. Secretary of State John Kerry was joining Obama in Riyadh, along with former Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and James Baker III, both of whom served Republican presidents. Former White House national security advisers Brent Scowcroft, Sandy Berger and Stephen Hadley also made the trip, as did Sen. John McCain, the Arizona republican who is a frequent critic of Obama's foreign policy in the Middle East. The shadow of Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, aboard is seen on arrival at King Khalid International Airport, in Riyadh . Sword-wielding palace guards stood at the entrance of Erga Palace as President Obama arrived to meet the new Saudi king . The palace guards stood at attention for the American guests . Top members of the Saudi military - from all branches - were on hand to greet the American delegation at the airport . CIA Director John Brennan and Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, which overseas military activity in the Middle East, were also taking part in Tuesday's meetings with the Saudis. 'It meets the threshold of being bipartisan, high-level and people who worked very closely with Saudi Arabia over many years,' said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. Despite vast differences of opinions on many issues, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have worked in close coordination to address evolving security concerns in the tumultuous region. Most recently, Saudi Arabia became one of a handful of Arab nations that have joined the U.S. in launching airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. In his initial days on the throne, the 79-year-old Salman has given little indication that he plans to bring fundamental changes to his country's policies. In a nationally televised address shortly after his half brother's death, Salman vowed to hew to 'the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment.' Obama acknowledged that the U.S. willingness to pursue close ties with Saudi Arabia despite human rights abuses often makes America's allies uncomfortable. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi shook hands with the new kind. She was part of the American delegation that traveled to Saudi Arabia with Obama . Senator John McCain was also in attendance at Erga Palace to meet King Salman . US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Joseph Westphal was among the US delegation . George H.W. Bush's former Secretary of State, James Baker, was in attendance, as well . 'The trend-line is one that I will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency,' Obama said, 'and that is to make the case to our friends and allies that if they want a society that is able to sustain itself in this day and age, then they're going to have to change how they do business.' Obama's presidency has also been marked by occasional strains with the Saudi royal family. Abdullah, the 90-year-old monarch who died Friday, had pressed the U.S. to take more aggressive action to force Syrian President Bashar Assad from power. The royal family is also deeply skeptical of Obama's diplomacy with rival Iran. Salman is a veteran of the country's top leadership and well-versed in diplomacy from nearly 50 years as the governor of the capital Riyadh. He is known as a mediator of disputes within the sprawling royal family who increasingly took on the duties of the king as the ailing Abdullah became more incapacitated. Several regional leaders traveled to Saudi Arabia to attend Abdullah's Muslim-only funeral Friday. Since then, a string of Western leaders and top dignitaries have announced plans to travel to the kingdom to pay their respects and meet the newly enthroned king.","President Barack Obama defended the US relationship with Saudia Arabia despite funding for terrorism and human rights abuses .

010f702d290fad77dfc35f4e188c2dfcc6f9b87c,"By . James  Nye . In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people. Speaking to NBC's Tom Brokaw for an interview that will air on Tuesday, Mortenson, 56, said that while he admitted to hearing the 'alarms' over his 2006 work, he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects. Famously claiming that he had met Mother Teresa, although she had died three years previously, Mortenson begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis-spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet. New beginning: Greg Mortenson speaks with NBC's Tom Brokwa and claims that he told falsehoods in his book because of his dramatic zeal to raise money for his humanitarian projects . Claiming in his interview with Brokaw that events did transpire in Three Cups of Tea as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - Mortenson said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes. 'It still just has puzzled me and why there wasn't, at some point, in your mind, an alarm that went off and said, 'this just isn't right in some way,' Brokaw asked in the interview. No more lies: Tom Mortenson said that he is interested in the public granting him a second chance after the lies he told in his best selling memoir Three Cups of Tea . 'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said. 'I didn't listen to them. I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.' After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. Mortenson himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther . The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity. Mortenson is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. Also noted as questionable was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Shamashatu, Pakistan: Greg Mortenson from Bozeman, Montana the former executive director of the Central Asia Institute, listens as newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan tell their stories on break from making bricks . However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items. Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said. Fabrications: Mortenson's 2006 book ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace...One School at a Time"" chronicled his failed attempt to climb K2 . When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person. The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation. Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards. In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General. The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents. The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves. The charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person's hands, the audit found. ‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important. However, serious internal problems in the management of CAI surfaced,’ Attorney General Steve Bullock said in the report. ‘Despite the severity of their errors, CAI is worth saving.’ Mortenson was permanently removed as CAI's executive director in November, 2012. Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 . Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery. The investigation by Montana's Attorney General also found that CAI spent $4.93million on advertising and promoting Mortenson's books, costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did. CAI paid $2million in charter flights for Mortenson to keep his rigorous speaking engagement schedule before he started paying for his own travel in 2011. The investigation found that in many cases he was ‘double-dipping,’ where CAI paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel, which Mortenson pocketed. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . 'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath . Mortenson and his family also charged personal items to CAI in 2009-2010 amounting to $75,276 that included ‘LL Bean clothing, iTunes, luggage, luxurious accommodations and even vacations,’ according to the report. The controversy became tragic in November of 2011 when co-author of Three Cups of Tea, David Oliver Relin committed suicide. Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book. Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children. His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'","Greg Mortenson has given his first interview since huge controversy over false claims in his best selling 2006 memoir Three Cups of Tea .

0110884d2a279c6249d21c1480548ac9bf985cfb,"A spacecraft that is due to arrive at the former planet Pluto later this year is carrying the ashes of the astronomer who first discovered the icy world. Clyde Tombaugh spotted the tiny gleaming object - which at 1,430 miles across is around two thirds the diametre of the Moon - as a dot on the edge of our solar system in 1930. On his death in January 1997, Mr Tombaugh requested that his ashes be sent into space. Clyde Tombaugh, pictured above in 1990, requested his remains be flown into space after his death in 1997 and his ashes are now approaching Pluto, the icy world on the edge of the solar system that he discovered . Now his remains are about to visit the world that he discovered, onboard a space probe that has been slowly flying through the solar system for the past nine years. A small container holding his remains is fixed to the upper deck of the spacecraft, bearing the inscription: 'Interned herin are the remains of American Clyde W Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system's ""third zone"".' Named by an 11-year-old girl after the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto is one of the least understood objects in our solar system. It is so far away that it appears barely as a pinprick in the sky even through the most powerful telescopes on Earth. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed a fuzzy picture of a molasses coloured world that teams with activity. Over time Pluto has also apparently grown redder, perhaps due to seasonal changes. No one is certain what is causing the coloured splotches, but the surface is thought to be mainly composed of frozen water and rock. Chemicals such as nitrogen and methane are thought to lie frozen beneath the icy crust. Pluto's orbit is highly eccentric, or far from circular, which means its distance from the sun can vary considerably. At times Pluto may come close enough to the sun for some of the frozen nitrogen and methane to turn into gas, giving it a thin and temporary atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity, which is a little more than one-twentieth that of Earth's, causes this atmosphere to extend much higher in altitude than Earth's. Pluto's surface is one of the coldest places in the solar system at roughly -375F (minus 225 degrees C). The £460 million New Horizon's mission will make him the first 'human' contact mankind has had with the dwarf planet. However, at more than 3.67 billion miles from the Sun, it is an inhospitable place. Temperatures on the surface plummet to -375 degrees F (-225 degrees C), cold enough for nitrogen and methane to freeze, and there is little atmosphere. Nasa's New Horizon's spacecraft woke up last month after a long hibernation as it makes its final approach towards Pluto. On 15 January it should finally be close enough to get a good look at Pluto and its moon Charon before beginning a fly past that will allow it to peer at the surface, taking measurements of the dust, gas and magnetic field that surround the former planet. Alan Stern, the principal investigator on the mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, in Boulder, Colorado, said: 'We’re currently in the very earliest stages of Pluto approach. 'When the encounter begins we’ll still be very far from Pluto, about 135 million miles (220 million kilometers).' He added, though, that by May they hoped to receive images that were better than the grainy images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. Pluto is among the most controversial objects in the solar system. Since its discovery by Mr Tombaugh up until 2006, Pluto was considered to be the ninth planet in the solar system. However, after the discovery of several other Pluto-sized objects in the far reaches of the solar system, astronomers decided to downgrade its status. They eventually settled on describing Pluto, and other objects, like it as dwarf planets. Its official designation is now asteroid number 134340. The artist's impression above shows the New Horizons spacecraft as it approaches Pluto and its three moons . Nasa obtained these images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2010 showing the coloured world of Pluto . However, scientists believe that Pluto is still vitally important and could hold a wealth of information about the far corners of our solar system and how it formed. Pluto is thought to be composed mainly of frozen water ice, methane, nitrogen and rocks surrounding a metal and rock core. New Horizons is carrying seven scientific instruments designed to take infrared and ultraviolet images of the planet, along with a high resolution camera. A particle spectrometer and a dust detector will also be used to measure the solar wind and other particles that are found around the former planet. Clyde Tombaugh, seen here in 1931, discovered Pluto in 1930 while working at the Lowel Observatory . The New Horizon's probe, seen above in this artist's impression, will use miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers to study the geology of Pluto and its moon Charon . This is one of the clearest images obtained of Pluto and its moon Charon by the Hubble Space Telescope . Dr Dennis Reuter, Nasa's co-investigator of the New Horizon's mission, said: 'While we have some idea of what we expect to see, I can’t help but think that history will repeat itself, and we’ll find ourselves astounded by something new, something we had never expected to see. 'I often think about the fact that the first time we’ve taken a close-up look at an object in the solar system, our understanding of that object immediately leaps forward. 'From volcanoes on Jupiter’s moon Io, to hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon Titan, to nitrogen geysers on Neptune’s moon Triton, and innumerable other examples, we’ve seen remarkable things that have taught us much about what goes on in our sun’s neighborhood.'

0110e6a6724d51ee21c64e138ef7a41027a2cd39,"Washington (CNN) -- A 31-year-old Oklahoma woman helped make medical history and started a chain of ""paying it forward"" when she decided to donate her kidney to a stranger halfway around the world, a man in Athens, Greece, officials announced Friday. Elizabeth Gay was the history-making donor, and Michalis Helmis was the recipient. His wife, Dora Papaioannou-Helmis, in return donated one of her kidneys to a patient in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The announcement of the first intercontinental organ exchange was made at a news conference held at the Greek Embassy in Washington. ""The joint effort of 'paying it forward' confirms what a huge difference an individual can make,"" Greek Ambassador Vassilis Kaskarelis said during the press conference. It ""confirms that we are all part of one world, that our fates are intertwined and that if we all work together, the possibilities are endless"" So far, one Greek and four American lives have been saved, and two more transplants are scheduled with a donor from Trinidad and Tobago joining the chain. Gay was the first in the chain of kidney transplants. ""The opportunity to help change someone's life, in itself, would be an honor but to potentially change the world -- it's huge,"" she said, ""I felt that ... a month of surgery and recovery in order to help give someone else life was completely worth it."" Before Gay could get the opportunity, though, Greek law had to be changed to allow the exchange. Greece's transplant law -- intended to prevent black market organ harvesting -- stated that only a first or second relative could donate a kidney. Papaioannou-Helmis, whose husband was in desperate need of a kidney transplant, spearheaded the efforts to change the law. After meeting with various officials and ministers, Helmis family attorney Vasilis Athanasiou said they ""understood what could be done."" The law was changed 18 months later, and the Greek couple flew to the United States in December 2011 so the husband could start the process and receive his new kidney. Four months later, she returned to donate her kidney to a Pennsylvania man -- a chain started by a practice called ""kidney pair donation."" ""Kidney pair donation is when two people come together -- someone loves somebody enough that they want to give them a kidney, but they find out that they're not compatible,"" said Dr. Michael Rees, director of transplantation at the University of Toledo, where the Gray/Helmis kidney exchange took place. ""So instead, they're willing to give a stranger a kidney so that another stranger can give their loved one a kidney."" ""As a donor I feel very well and I'm very calm,"" Papaioannou-Helmis, who attended Friday's news conference with her husband via Skype, said through a translator. ""Every day that I see Michalis well I'm very happy. And every day I think of Liz, and I think of the person that received my kidney, Mr. Charles Ripple and I wonder how he's doing, how he's feeling every day."" ""It's just been fabulous. Everything is working good,"" Ripple responded, ""I feel the best I've felt in a couple years.""

Waving her arms and yelling, this is the moment Dame Helen Mirren – dressed as the Queen – gave a band of drummers its marching orders. The actress admitted that she must have looked like a ‘batty old woman’ as she stormed out of the theatre where she was performing and told the noisy drumming troupe to shut up. Video footage clearly shows the Oscar-winner’s furious gesticulations as she attempted to quieten the deafening throng outside London’s Gielgud Theatre. Scroll down for video . Making a point: Helen Mirren is pictured today in a customised t-shirt relaying her message to a drumming troupe who disturbed her performance at London's Gielgud theatre - until she told them to keep quiet . The 67-year-old star was angry they had . disturbed the first half of her play with their drumming, designed to . promote gay and transgender festival As One In The Park. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she . said something 'had to be done' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor Paul Ritter could barely hear each . other speak. She said: 'I was so upset from struggling through . the scene with Paul that I literally walked straight off stage, straight . up the stairs and straight out the stage door and banged my way through . the crowd who were watching and said 'stop, you’ve got to stop right . now’ only I might have used stronger language than that. 'They were very sweet and stopped the . minute they knew I wasn’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the . streets of Soho on a Saturday night.' Angry: Helen Mirren, circled, storms out of the theatre to remonstrate with revellers outside the theatre . No messing: It is unclear what the famous actress said during the confrontation which was caught on camera . Woman on a mission: The actress is seen in this blurred footage trying to encourage the crowd to be quiet . Reports of her exact words differ, but it is clear the 67-year-old was, like Queen Victoria, not amused. Some said she told the group to ‘shut the **** up’. One is not amused: Helen Mirren as The Queen in play The Audience . Others said she ‘stomped out and shrieked “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here!” ’ Dame Helen is playing the Queen in The . Audience, a play about the monarch’s private weekly meetings with . various prime ministers at Buckingham Palace. Last week the role earned her an Olivier award for best actress. The play’s writer Peter Morgan also scripted the 2006 film The Queen, for which Dame Helen won an Oscar. Saturday night’s West End performance of the play was disturbed by the sound of drums five minutes before the interval. A . troupe of performers marched past the theatre in a parade designed to . promote As One In The Park, a festival for gay and transgender people . due to take place in East London this month. Followed by a crowd of around 200, the . musicians and dancers stopped outside a bar to perform a drum crescendo . – unaware they were drowning out Dame Helen’s lines. Now Dame Helen has revealed she would like to invite the performers to see her play. Audience . member Ben Scotchbrook told the Daily Mail that the actress finished . the first half without letting the noise affect her performance. When . the second half was interrupted by a lighting blackout, she went on . stage and revealed she had dealt with the source of the noise. ‘She was a real pro, she saved the day,’ said Mr Scotchbrook, a 43-year-old communications consultant from Buckinghamshire. ‘The noise was really irritating, but she didn’t get ruffled on stage. ‘In the interval I went out and tried . to ask the drummers to move on, to no effect. I don’t think they . realised they could be heard inside the theatre. Too loud: The band of drummers set to promote LGBT festival As One In The Park, seen in London's Soho, close to the Gielgud Theatre, which prompted Helen Mirren to leave her performance .

0113354e89ebda83b483c1af954ba86498174bee,"(CNN) -- London's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city, authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge. They even took the mast off the whopping vessel so it could squeeze underneath a motorway, with a gasp-inducing five centimeters to spare. The mast has now been reattached -- not that this five-storey floating hotel is going anywhere soon -- it doesn't even have an engine. ""It took two weeks to tow it here from Finland,"" explains Elzbieta Nowacka, Sunborn events and sales manager, during a tour of the 102-meter-long boat. ""To install an engine would have cost another Â£25 million ($44 million), so it was built without one on purpose."" Float your boat . The swanky superyacht now sits on the banks of east London's Royal Victoria Docks, and come late August it hopes to open its 136 rooms to the public, costing between $300 and $1,600 per night. Originally floating in conjunction with a luxury spa hotel in Finland, the vessel was given a refurbishment and tugged to the UK -- at a total cost of $67 million. ""You cannot refer to these rooms as simply cabins,"" says Nowacka, opening the door to one of the top-of-the-range executive suites, featuring its own sauna and a balcony big enough for 20 people. ""Not everybody can afford to go cruising on a superyacht, so this is a way of giving them a taste of how it could be."" Stepping inside the plush lobby I'm greeted with a golden staircase, the twinkling light from the water outside reflected on its buffered surface. ""A lot of people say it reminds them of the Titanic staircase,"" says Nowacka. ""We've had quite a few requests from clients for Titanic-themed events,"" she adds, without a hint of irony. Space race . In a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world, the Sunborn Superyacht Hotel has turned its gaze to London's many waterways -- and it's not the first European city in the company's sights. The company opened its $200 million Gibraltar hotel earlier this year, moored in the tiny territory located off the southern tip of Spain. There are also plans for another five-star ship in Barcelona. ""I think it is definitely the future of design, because there are so many cities with large marinas and rivers that could be used as well,"" said Nowacka. ""You can see it especially in central London, where we are running out of space in terms of building new hotels."" The London berth has been leased for the next 15 years, with views of looming skyscrapers, and the low roar of airplanes from nearby City Airport overhead. Step out onto the decking and it almost feels as though the planes are about to land right on board, and Nowacka is quick to point out the double-glazed windows render it silent inside. The hotel itself is attached to the land by two huge supporting arms, and connected to the electricity and sewerage mains. ""You cannot feel any movement, maybe eight millimeters, but it's impossible to feel seasick,"" says Nowacka, as we take in the view from the third-storey deck, the summer glare bouncing off the water. Energized East End? Decades ago, this part of London was a very different place. What was once one of the busiest ports in the world had become a deserted wasteland by 1980. So much so that the grim image of a ruined city was the perfect setting for Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam war film ""Full Metal Jacket."" It wasn't until the London Docklands Development Corporation redeveloped the site towards the end of the decade -- including the financial hub of Canary Wharf -- that the area was reborn. ""This superyacht hotel creates a new set of symbols for the area -- in terms of the wealth it represents, it's a huge change, "" said Georgina Young, senior curator at the Museum of London. ""Now it's all about service and luxury, so it's a very different idea of the Docklands. Much like London itself has moved from an industry economy to a service-based economy."" Gazing across the skyline from the sunlit deck of the multimillion-dollar superyacht hotel, the East End of old feels very far away indeed. Inspire: Superyacht expeditions to the ends of the earth .

In a blog post on the nascent R.E.M.cycle site, the blogger known as Analog Loyalist explained that Universal, the record company that owns the band's IRS Records catalog, issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice for an R.E.M. post on the writer's sister site The Power of Independent Trucking featuring a restored version of the band's first cassette demo, with early renditions of ""Radio Free Europe,"" ""Sitting Still"" and ""White Tornado.""

""These were demos freely given away by the band. On low-fi C45 cassettes. And the IFPI thinks it's their business how?"" The blogger is now reconsidering the wisdom of pursuing the project.

01166936e87455f7b7e66a4f8c14f60043287b15,"Omaha, Nebraska (CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across Iowa, holding campaign-style events and fund-raisers with local politicians as the potential Republican presidential contender barnstorms the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul's route will take him through nine cities from the state's western border to its eastern edge. The Kentucky Republican will also help the state Republican Party open multiple offices ahead of the midterm elections. ""It's very important for Sen. Paul to hear the concerns of average Iowans as well as job creators,"" said Steve Grubbs, Paul's chief Iowa strategist and a longtime political operative in the Hawkeye State. As Paul lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, he has kept Iowa a top priority. This is his fourth trip there since the 2012 presidential election. Paul will leave the state on Wednesday, a day before the start of the Iowa State Fair, a popular venue for presidential hopefuls. A small swarm of other potential GOP contenders will travel to Iowa this weekend to attend a popular event for social conservatives. But Paul won't be there, preferring to give the candidates he's been helping some breathing room and allow them to be the focus. Poll: Republicans slightly behind Clinton in key 2016 states . Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, said the senator's plan isn't a bad idea, especially in a midterm election year. ""You want to come in and do favors for Iowa politicians,"" he said. ""If you're at the state fair, the attention is on you and not the person you're trying to help."" ""Next year, you call in those favors,"" he added. ""That's how it works."" Paul actually starts the week in Omaha, Nebraska, where he'll appear publicly with Ben Sasse, the GOP nominee for Nebraska's open Senate seat. Then, he'll quickly hop across the state line to help the Iowa GOP open an office in Council Bluffs, where he's expected to appear with the state's GOP Senate nominee, Joni Ernst. Potential 2016 GOP candidates tout conservative principles in Iowa . Later Monday he travels north to Sioux City for another office opening, and then to a fund-raiser farther north, in Okoboji, for Rep. Steve King, a longtime congressman with considerable sway among the state's social conservatives. Tuesday morning Paul is back on the road for a fund-raiser in Clear Lake, before a stop at the Iowa GOP office in Hiawatha. Continuing east, he'll attend a fund-raiser for Mariannette Miller-Meeks' congressional campaign in Iowa City, and then he has two events in Davenport, including a tour of the corporate headquarters of Von Maur department stores. Wednesday he attends a breakfast in Urbandale and wraps up his public appearances for the week with another GOP office opening in the same city, a suburb of Des Moines. On some issues, Paul and Christie sound a lot alike . Paul's political action committee, RANDPAC, has made two big hires from Iowa in recent months: Grubbs -- who's also a former state representative and state party chairman -- and A.J. Spiker, a prominent figure among Iowa's libertarian-leaning Republicans. Paul's father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, generated a huge following in Iowa during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. The libertarian movement went on to gain sizable influence in the state's Republican Party after the election -- Spiker, for example, became state GOP chairman -- but mainstream Republicans took back control of the party earlier this year. A big question will be whether Rand Paul, who's considered more moderate than his father, can re-energize the so-called Liberty faction of the state party, while also garnering support from its social conservatives and mainstream Republicans. ""One of the reasons I signed on to work with Sen. Paul is I could see how he appeals to all of our party,"" Grubbs said. ""There are very few candidates who have that ability to unify our party. I think that he can do that.""","Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across the first-in-the-nation caucus state .

01176065ec41c9c63280f36a4d0b3b27e9143570,"(CNN) -- It's been a year since the Occupy Wall Street movement sprang up. Since then, it has fizzled, but this does not mean that the underlying issues that gave rise to the protests have gone away. Until last year, mainstream political discourse did not include nearly as much emphasis on such populist concerns as rising income inequality, tax policies that favor the rich, growing influence by large corporate interests in elections and the reckless deregulation of financial institutions that resulted in the 2008 crisis. It is hard to miss them now. These concerns still impact 99% of Americans. Even if Occupy protests have petered out, the movement has affected the political narrative in our country. Meet the original 'Occupiers' We can see Occupy's impact in the current presidential campaign. Whereas Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election strategy focused on the idea of ""triangulation"" -- taking centrist positions on key economic issues to isolate his Republican opponent on the right -- President Barack Obama has taken on much more of a populist stance, mobilizing his Democratic base and economically stressed independents against an opponent whom his campaign is depicting as the quintessential representative of the 1%. Occupy activists justifiably express skepticism over how much to trust the president's left-leaning rhetoric when his actual economic policies have been decidedly centrist. Still, the fact that Obama's re-election campaign recognizes the advantage of decrying unfair tax laws and similar policies that affect middle class Americans is indicative of how the tone has shifted. Unfortunately, much of the decline of the Occupy movement can also be attributed to the distraction from this year's election campaigns. Despite the Democrats' mixed record, the unions and many other potential allies necessary in building a real movement have felt obliged to focus their energy on re-electing Obama and helping other Democratic candidates. Some police repression and serious violations of civil liberties by city authorities certainly crippled the Occupy protests as well, as did the media's tendency to focus too much on its more violent or flaky elements. But, this does not mean that all is lost. What was the point of the Occupy movement? Share your view with CNN iReport . The Egyptian Revolution and other unarmed civil insurrections that have swept the world recently did not start and end during a few dramatic weeks or months when millions of people were on the streets. They were the culmination of many years of struggle, often initiated by young radicals engaging in small but creative demonstrations. The Occupy protesters, even at their greatest numbers, were never able to do what successful movements must do in terms of developing a well-thought-out strategy, clearly articulated political demands, a logical sequencing of tactics and well-trained and disciplined activists who don't vandalize property or fight cops. Indeed, the Occupy protesters never developed enough of the structural elements necessary to truly be considered a ""movement."" Most importantly, those involved never recognized that colorful protests are no substitute for door-to-door organizing among real people. A look back: Meet the 99% . The United States has a long history of popular social and economic struggles, from the abolitionists to the Populists to the suffragists to the civil rights movement and, throughout much of that history, the trade unions. As Thomas Jefferson once beckoned his fellow Americans: ""crush... the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our government to trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country."" If the pressing concerns of the 99% are not addressed, don't be surprised if new incarnations of the Occupy movement emerge in the near future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Zunes.","It's been a year since the Occupy Wall Street movement sprang up .

011828b5f67bdd49df4bc786f8070c4d341a656c,"(CNN) -- A report in South Korean media is fueling the ongoing speculation about the deteriorating health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il, seen in an undated state-issued photo, has made only two public appearances since August. YTN News, citing unidentified intelligence sources in South Korea and China, reported Monday that the 67-year-old leader has pancreatic cancer. South Korea's Unification Ministry flatly denied the report, which comes a week after a frail-looking Kim appeared in public for the first time in months. Doctors told South Korea's state-run Yonhap News Agency that it is impossible to tell the status of Kim's health from the recent video of the reclusive leader. Kim appeared at a July 8 ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of his father's death. He seemed frail and gaunt as he walked into the service flanked by senior party and military officials. North Korea's official KCNA news agency has routinely criticized the Western media for erroneously exaggerating the status of Kim's health. Last week's appearance was his second since he was widely reported to have suffered a stroke in August. Kim was seen in April when he was reappointed as chairman of North Korea's military board. His recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he was ready to groom an heir. The rules governing transfer of power in the secretive communist nation are unclear, but it is widely believed that Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong Un, will succeed him.  Facts about North Korea » . In April, the North Korean leader named Kim Jong Un and brother-in-law Chang Sung Taek to the country's powerful National Defense Commission. Chang, who is married to Kim Jong Il's sister, has effectively run the country in the wake of the leader's health problems, according to TIME Magazine.

With hundreds of plastic legs, arms, and heads stacked high in boxes, it looks like a haunting resting place for hundreds of unwanted dolls discarded by girls who no longer want to play with them. But although Sydney's Famous Original Doll Hospital does have a cemetery for doll parts that are beyond repair, many of the toy parts littering the workshop are waiting to be given a new lease of life. For the company has been the saviour of hundreds of thousands of Australian girls devastated when their beloved doll has lost a limb or been damaged in an overly boisterous game and has revived millions of childhood memories. Centenary Spare doll's parts sit waiting to be used for repair at Sydney's Original Doll Hospital which is celebrating its 100th birthday this year . Concentrating: Gail Grainger works on a doll at Sydney's Original Doll Hospital in Bexley . Spare parts: Hundreds of spare dolls' arms and legs are kept in boxes at the hospital's workshop in Bexley, Sydney . Repairs: Doll body parts are hung up to dry after being painted at the workshop . The workshop is about to mark 100 years of repairing dolls after it was opened thanks to a shipping error in the Australian city back in 1913. And despite changing technology meaning that many modern children are more interested in the latest gadgets or computer games, the business is still going strong, with dolls sent from all over Australia and even across the sea from New Zealand for repair. The shop was founded by accident by Harold Chapman Snr in 1913. His brother was in the business of importing celluloid dolls from Japan but the rubber bands that held them together would often disintegrate and the dolls would be damaged. Waiting room: An old fashioned doll, or 'patient', sits waiting to be repaired in the Sydney Doll Hospital . Resting place: A sign saying 'The Doll's Cemetary' hangs over a section of the warehouse that is used for waste parts . Haunting: Spare dolls heads, some needed new paintwork, others needing repairs to their eyes, are piled high . Fortunately for his brother, Mr Chapman Snr found a way to fix the dolls and set up a section dedicated to doll repair in his general store. But demand for doll repair grew as word spread and the business was soon expanded. It was taken over by Mr Chapman Snr's son, also called Harold, in the 1930s and expanded the type of product being fixed to leather goods, toys and umbrellas. The start of World War Two really saw the doll hospital thrive however. Restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods to Australia meant that children and collectors had to make do with their old dolls instead of buying new ones and more repairs were needed. Getting a spruce up: Gail Grainger works on making the torso of a doll look the part before its limbs are reattached . Accidental beginnings: The Doll Hospital was opened after founder Harold Chapman Snr's brother ordered celluloid dolls from Japan which were damaged in transit . Labour of love: Current Hospital owner Geoff Chapman, the third generation of the Chapman family to run it, is pictured in the workshop . At one point during the war the hospital had 70 'nurses' working in six different repair rooms. By its 95th birthday, the hospital had carried out a staggering 2.5mllion repairs. Now, the hospital has been passed onto its third generation of the Chapman family, with Harold Jnr's son Geoff now in charge. He said on the company's website: 'There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the smile on a little girl's face when she comes to collect her beloved doll. 'People often have tears in their eyes when they have to leave their precious dolls, but tears of joy when they come to collect them and see the transformation.' Thriving: Business really boomed during World War Two when restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods meant that new dolls were hard to come by .

A Minnesota air stewardess has finally welcomed home her three adopted daughters seven years after she first met the girls in a Guatemalan orphanage. Suann Hibbs met her daughters in 2008, but when the Guatemalan government cut back on foreign adoptions the family were left in legal limbo. It took seven years, 30 trips abroad and a lot of help from Senator Amy Klobuchar before officials finally allowed Ms Hibbs to take the three sisters home last week. Scroll down for video . Mother's love: Suann Hibbs hugs one of her three adopted daughters . It is a dream come true for Ms Hibbs who had been keen to become a mother for years. 'I still feel like this is so surreal. I . mean, I just have to pinch myself. When they come in, in the morning . and crawl in bed with me. I just have goose bumps thinking about it,' she told CBS News. When she first met the children, twins Savanna and Sophia were one-year-olds and their sister Sydney was a newborn. 'I just fell in love with them as soon as I saw them. I just thought morally, I just can't let them go,' Ms Hibbs, who is not married and found the girls through a church adoption group, said. The adoption agency Ms Hibbs had used estimated that within six to nine months the paperwork would be completed and the girls would be with her in Edina, Minneapolis. But the process was massively delayed as developing countries including Guatemala started to restrict foreign adoptions while they tackled problems with fraud and child trafficking. Family: Twins Savanna and Sophia were a year old and their little sister Sydney was a newborn when Suann first met them . Growing up: By the time the sisters finally arrived at their new home the twins were 8 and Sydney was 7 . In November 2007, her adoption case was put on hold during a country-wide investigation, and it looked as though she may lose her children. While the case was being slowly processed the three sisters were moved between several orphanages and foster homes. The constant moving made it hard for Ms Hibbs to keep track of them, and also meant that the girls have not had any formal education. 'They needed a permanent home,' Ms Klobuchar, who met Guatemalan officials on Ms Hibbs' behalf, said. Settling in: After living in several orphanages the sisters finally have a permanent place to call home . 'It took a little time, but . they got to the right place and allowed these children to be adopted.' She added: 'A lot of times when you personally meet . with the ambassador like I did and you tell the story of these three . little girls and this mother who has been trying for seven years, they . listen.' Although the girls, now aged eight and seven, speak only a little English, they are settling into their new home well. They will start school in a couple of weeks and attend summer classes to help them catch up with their new classmates.","Suann Hibbs was left in legal limbo after Guatemala put hold on foreign adoptions .

0119b8517cfe7ae6fdc40631c9cbaea617453bce,"(CNN) -- There is nothing new under the sun, the saying goes, and it could not be more true than with the recycled literature of the popular ""mommy porn"" trilogy ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Just this week, Universal Pictures acquired the movie rights to the bodice ripper for reportedly more than $5 million as traditional publisher Knopf/Vintage promises to turn the book, which has been sold mainly as an e-book, into a paperback version with a 750,000 copy print release next month. However hot the property appears, the plot and devices are centuries old, leading us to wonder whether the commercial success signals a breakthrough in women's sexual freedom or a new low in women's debasement. The novel tells the story of Anastasia Steele, who finishes college by losing her virginity to billionaire Christian Grey, becoming his ""submissive"" in a sadomasochistic relationship. The e-book version of the trilogy has gone viral with mature women readers, even as critics have denounced the book's reactionary gender politics. Neither extreme explains the novel's compelling relevance. Though no literary masterpiece, ""Fifty Shades"" is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent ""Twilight"" vampire series. Its abundant references to classic literature unlock a subtler commentary on enduring obstacles to women's individual freedom and rights. Whenever power relations are unequal, the novel implies, sexual consent is never black and white: It is always fifty shades of gray. Paying attention to its literary signposts shows what has changed for women in that regard and what has not. When ""Fifty Shades"" begins, the heroine's favorite pastime is to curl up with a good book, not a whip. After the hero asks her to sign a contract defining her role as his submissive, she tells the reader, ""[Austen's] Elizabeth Bennet would be outraged, [Bronte's] Jane Eyre too frightened and [Hardy's] Tess would succumb, just as I have."" Insistent references like this remind us that ""Fifty Shades"" is recycling the classic novel plot about a vulnerable young woman and a brooding older man. The hero has the lion's share of socioeconomic power; the heroine has only her magnetic strength and intelligence. News: Erotic book surges up best seller list . The classic plot promises that by steeling her virginity and holding out for marriage, women can achieve intellectual equality and love. Those who fail come to bad ends, but the victorious novel heroine learns the hero's secrets and gains ownership of his heart and true self. This last is exactly the fantasy that ""Fifty Shades"" sells. There is nothing new either about this plot's association with pornographic whips and chains. Alongside the genre of the novel, the 18th century saw the emergence of modern pornography, from John Cleland's ""Fanny Hill,"" to works by the Marquis de Sade, whom Christian Grey imitates as a confessed ""sadist."" Gothic horror novels, which specialized in sadomasochistic innuendo and supernatural phenomena, were also sensationally popular. The whip and the vampire emerged in tandem with the marriage plot and chick lit. Christian gives Anastasia an app for all the 18th- and 19th-century novels in the British Library, but he also presents her a $14,000 first edition of Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles."" The still-disputed question Tess poses concerns whether the heroine is raped or seduced. Though Anastasia Steele is never raped, her individual agency is equally ambiguous. She refuses to sign Christian's contract, but she lets him spank, whip, chain and blindfold her for the remainder of the trilogy. When the debasement gets too extreme, she walks away (like Jane Eyre upon discovering Rochester's bigamy). Yet she returns, echoing Tess: ""The physical pain you inflicted was not as bad as the pain of losing you."" Throughout, her self-punishing ""subconscious"" drives her away from Christian, while her libidinous ""inner goddess"" makes her dread losing him. If she doesn't submit, she will have only her books. In exchange for her masochistic submission, Anastasia receives an infinite array of explosive orgasms and Christian's love and protection. Sadistic Christian always uses a condom, never uses porn and always puts her pleasure first. He loves, cherishes, provides and above all uses his power to protect Anastasia -- all while gradually opening up to her, making himself psychologically vulnerable. SPOILER ALERT: It turns out that he is a sadist because he was once victimized by older women. Lest you think women are unequal, the novel emphasizes the hero's ultimate powerlessness. No wonder female readers are falling for this story. When the story was first popularized in the 18th century, women had virtually no individual rights. They could not vote, could rarely own property and were themselves seen as property -- so much so that if a wife had an extramarital affair, a husband could sue her lover for damages. Though many things have changed, women remain economically disadvantaged, are far more likely to be violated than titillated by the porn industry and are publicly called ""sluts"" for demanding insurance coverage for birth control. The enduring appeal of a plot like that of ""Fifty Shades"" suggests that even in 2012, most women cannot imagine how such inequality might disappear. Instead they clamor for the delusion that submission to men's greater power means being taken care of by them. Of course, pornography can be seductive, and ""Fifty Shades"" is hot. Less enjoyable is the undercurrent about women's lack of rights. Christian tells Anastasia, ""You need to free your mind and listen to your body."" But to what extent can women enjoy free play in a country where those going by the name of ""Christian"" mount legislation forcing them to bear children conceived in rape? When poor young women like Christian's ""crack whore"" mother are denied access to birth control? By enjoying a porn of their own, women can at least indulge the fantasy that their pleasure comes first even as politicians are devising new forms of punishment.

Paul Griffith, 75, pictured, set off the security scanner’s alarm at Stansted airport when travelling to Malaga for a week’s holiday. He removed his shoes as requested, but said: ‘I am not Muslim am I?’ Paul Griffith was on his way to Malaga when airport staff asked him to remove his shoes. His response landed him arrested upon his return to the UK . A security guard accused him of racism and called the police, saying he was upset by the remark. 'One minute I am queuing up to get on a plane and the next I am confronted by two armed policemen. 'They said I had used racist language and took me to an office in the terminal,' Mr Griffith said yesterday. Mr Griffith was allowed to go on his trip but was arrested when he returned. He was charged with causing ‘racially or religiously aggravated harassment, alarm or distress’. 'When I got back I had to wait six hours before they interviewed me again, arrested me and said that was being charged with causing racially aggravated harassment. 'I was photographed, had my finger prints taken and they also took a DNA swab from my mouth. 'Then they said I would have to go to my local police station. When I went to Colchester police station I was told I had been charged with an offence under the Crime and Disorder Act but that I could accept a caution instead. 'I refused to do that - I had done nothing wrong and I wasn’t going to admit to a criminal charge if I wasn’t guilty of any crime.' The CPS failed to substantiate claims by airport staff at Stansted (pictured) that Mr Griffith's comment was threatening or abusive . The 75-year-old was asked by staff at the airport to remove his shoes before he made the comment (file image) Months later he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court where he pleaded not guilty to the offence. The case was adjourned to last Thursday, but with just 24 hours before appearing, the Crown Prosecution Service suddenly dropped the charge due to lack of evidence. The retired hairdressing salon owner, from Colchester, Essex, yesterday criticised the police for their heavy-handedness. ‘I have never fallen foul of the law before and the whole affair has been a complete waste of police time, the court’s time, my time as well as taxpayers’ money. ‘It has been incredibly stressful – all because I asked a question and apparently dared to use the M word.’ Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS East of England, Frank Ferguson said: 'Following receipt of the evidential file a full review of the evidence took place. 'In order to successfully prosecute a charge of racially or religiously aggravated disorderly conduct, we first have to show that the language used was threatening or abusive and in these particular circumstances we could not show that to the high criminal standard required.'","Paul Griffith was stopped at Stansted airport on his way to Malaga .

011bbaa3b1b61a2ce1912fd62a31f516dd8316e8,"Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused in a separate incident of eluding an officer and resisting arrest, it was revealed today. State troopers cited Hernandez January 1 for speeding down a highway north of Denver in her mother's car after the girl's driver's license had been revoked. The citation shows Hernandez was driving 80mph in a 55mph zone, and the trooper noted that she was resisting arrest in a way that risked serious injury to him or others. It does not provide other details of the case. Scroll down for video . Earlier incident: Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused of speeding and resisting arrest . Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg . Colorado State Patrol Trooper Josh Lewis would not comment on the case.  Hernandez's uncle, Alberto Hernandez, referred questions to an attorney who did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Court records show the Adams County district attorney's office had the citation dismissed after Hernandez died. Police say Hernandez was shot dead Monday after she drove a stolen car toward an officer in a residential alley in Denver. The Denver shooting also brought protests and a demand for a special prosecutor. On Friday, Hernandez's family called for a federal civil rights investigation into her death. In a statement released in English and Spanish, Hernandez's parents said they want the US Department of Justice to investigate her death, and for US Attorney John Walsh in Colorado to oversee the criminal investigation of the officers involved. The family said it doesn't trust Denver police to conduct a fair and timely investigation, and that the department has a history of exonerating its officers. The statement came after the parents retained lawyer Qusair Mohamedbhai, who has been involved in a number of other high-profile civil rights cases against Denver police and sheriff's deputies. Mohamedbhai represented a former Denver jail inmate to whom the city paid $3.3million in July to settle a jail abuse lawsuit. The allegations in the lawsuit filed by Jamal Hunter were so egregious they prompted a federal judge to request a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the city's police and the sheriff's departments. In the shooting of Hernandez, Police Chief Robert White has said the two officers repeatedly told her and four other teens to get out of the stolen car. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez (right) is asking for a second autopsy to be conducted on her daughter (left) White said Thursday an officer might have been injured trying to get out of the way of the vehicle. He initially said the two officers opened fire after one was struck by the car. The incident remained under investigation. A passenger in the car, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, has disputed that account, saying the officers did not yell commands before they shot Hernandez through the driver's side window. The passenger also claimed that Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. White said it's too soon to judge whether Officers Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, acted appropriately in shooting Hernandez. Jordan suffered a fractured leg. No one has been charged with the theft of the car, a 2000 Honda Civic that was reported missing Sunday night in Federal Heights. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandz, Jessica's mother, on Wednesday called for an independent autopsy on her daughter because she does not trust the official investigation. The request came as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles. A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home. She leaves behind five siblings . A passenger in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle  after being shot . Mrs Hernandez, a mother of six, said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.' 'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life. She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice. The grieving mother also criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,' The shooting was the fourth time in seven months that Denver police have fired at a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat. Protester Bruce Young waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the Denver District Attorney's office . Department policy encourages officers to move out of the way of a moving car rather than use their firearm. But it also allows them to shoot if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. The incidents have prompted the department and the city's independent monitor to review policies and training related to such shootings. Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras. Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held. Candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast Denver . Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home . The US Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy. The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire. It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.' Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control.","State troopers cited Jessica Hernandez January 1 for doing 80mph in 55mph zone .

011c6a42c94c5949a234d1a35d88d904ee9db463,"Seeking freedom: Daniel Villegas, 35, has spent the last 18 years in prison after being convicted of killing two men . A Texas man who has spent nearly two decades in prison after admitting to killing two men in a drive-by shooting when he was 16 year old is now asking for a new trial, and he may yet get a chance at freedom. Villegas, who is now 35, continues to insist that the confession that led to his conviction, and which he has since recanted, was obtained by coercion. A private investigator hired by his supporters, a team from Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth and a pair of men exonerated after serving time for murder have backed up his claims of innocence . Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer. ‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com. ‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning. I had never heard of Daniel before.’ Villegas’ defense team filed a writ of habeas corpus, citing ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence as their reasons for retrial. The 35-year-old convict will learn his fate on Thursday when Texas 409th District Court Judge Sam Medrano is expected to rule on whether to grant him one last chance to prove his innocence in what will be his third murder trial. ‘I'm going to delve into this,’ Medrano told El Paso Times. ‘I'm going to start working on the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. When I believe that I may be ready to make my decision I will notify the parties.’ The evidence the defense submitted includes 13 discs containing the full length conversations Villegas had with family and friends while at the El Paso County Jail. Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders . Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him . Prosecutors objected to the discs with more than 400 phone conversations being admitted, dismissing them as irrelevant to the case. For Villegas, the chain of events that landed him behind bars goes back to 1993 when four men, including Hernandez, Juan Carlos Medina and murder victims Armando ‘Mando’ Lazo, 18, and Robert England, 17, were walking along Electric Avenue in El Paso, Texas. A car with three people inside pulled up, and one passenger demanded ‘Que Barrio?’ – a slang term which means ‘what gang are you with?’ In response, two of the men ran away, and two others were shot dead in a vacant lot. England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene. Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh. His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help. Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect. The 16-year-old boy was a high school dropout and a known gang member who had a reputation for telling tall tales in an effort to boost his street cred. Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting . The teen was arrested in connection with the deadly shootings, and just hours later police got a confession penned in a third-grade level of writing. In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims. According to Villegas’ team, then-detective Al Marquez used physical violence and threatened the frightened teen into signing the confession, which proved crucial during the trial since investigators had no evidence linking the 16-year-old to the scene of the crime. 'I'm not a saint, but even thought I'm not, you know, I'm not a killer either,' Villegas said in an interview with News Channel 9 last November. The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders. ‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News. ‘They pushed him. They had other leads but they just dropped the ball and wanted the easy way out.’ Team effort: Villegas' supporters claim that he had inadequate legal representation during his trial and is innocent . Villegas’ first trial ended in hung jury, but in a second trial that took place in 1995, the panel came back with a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Freddie Bonilla, the private detective who was hired by Villegas’ distant relative, has revealed that court-appointed attorney John Gates failed in his duties as a counselor, spending only 40 hours preparing for his client’s murder trial. Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case. Joshua Tepfer, project director at the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, told FoxNews.com evidence shows the murders were committed by brothers Rudy and Javier Flores, who allegedly told a witness Villegas was in jail for a crime they did. Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence . Javier Flores has since died and his surviving sibling is currently serving jail time on drug-related charges. However, El Paso Assistant District Attorney John Briggs said the jury in the second trial reached the correct verdict and dismissed Villegas' claims of ineffective counsel. ‘He has provided no new evidence, which is required for someone who is claiming actual innocence,’ Briggs said.","Daniel Villegas, 35, was convicted in 1995 of gunning down two men in a drive-by shooting .

011ce55ece7d96895c09fec5b3aa3352a67e21df,"(CNN) -- Nothing tempts hackers quite like a high-profile new target. A website is offering a bounty of more than $16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone 5S. The site, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer-security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. It invites donors to contribute to the bounty, which so far includes an assortment of cash, bitcoins (a form of digital currency), several bottles of booze and ""a dirty sex book."" A successful hack of the phone had not been verified as of Monday morning, although a German hackers' group claimed over the weekend to have bypassed the biometric security of the iPhone 5S by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the image to create a fake finger to unlock the phone. They demonstrated their exploits in this video. ""We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token,"" said Frank Rieger, a spokesperson for the group, the Chaos Computer Club, in a post online. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? According to terms DePetrillo posted on Twitter, to collect the bounty a hacker must lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow them to unlock an iPhone 5S in less than five tries. All the steps must be documented on video. ""The whole point of #istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of Apple's Touch ID security and implementation,"" DePetrillo said Saturday on Twitter. ""I personally believe (for once) a company has implemented a unique feature (Touch ID) in a reasonably secure way,"" he added in another tweet. DePetrillo tweeted Sunday that he had been in contact with the Chaos Computer Club and was ""waiting on a complete video documentation of the process (of their hack) before declaring valid."" The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Apple calls the new security system Touch ID. Phone owners must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. Other users' fingerprints will not unlock the phone, which protects it from thieves. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. A Minnesota man posted a video Friday to CNN iReport that showed him using the paw of his pet Chihuahua to unlock his new iPhone. DePetrillo and Graham are so-called ""white hat"" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised. Apple did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.","NEW: German hackers' group claims to have hacked the iPhone 5S .

Beggars belief: Two men kneel with their foreheads on the pavement as they ask for donations to help look after a camel with no feet. Animal rights activists say such beggars are scammers that mutilate animals . Mutilating people, they said, no longer seemed to gather as many generous donations, with people more often making a wide berth around limbless beggars. Police were unable to take any action against the gang as they hadn't broken the law. The camel has been used for begging since at least April and, according to local media, brings in lots of cash. The men claimed that the camel was a wild camel that they had rescued after it had been run over by a train. They denied mutilating it, saying they had taken it upon themselves to care for it and needed the money for food.

Hundreds of chidldren aged 10 and under have hospitalised suffering from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use . Children as young as seven are being admitted to hospital with alcohol problems, an investigation has found. Shocking new figures have revealed dozens of under-10s have been hospitalised suffering from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use. A Freedom of Information request to all . of England's 166 NHS hospital trusts revealed a total of 380 children . aged 10 or under were treated for alcohol intoxication between 2008 and . 2012. Worryingly, 67 of the trusts approached either failed or refused to the Freedom of Information request, meaning the figures are likely to be even higher. The most alarming incident was that of an intoxicated seven-year-old boy said to be 'addicted' to alcohol who was treated at a hospital in Sussex. The Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust described his diagnosis as 'alcohol intoxication' and the reason for his attendance as 'alcohol related'. 'The primary diagnosis was a mental and behavioural disorder due to acute intoxication with alcohol,' a report said. For patient confidentiality reasons, the trust would not divulge any other detail except to state he was admitted to hospital in 2008. In another case, a 10-year-old boy was admitted to a hospital in Devon after drinking so much he collapsed. Meanwhile, at least 25 girls and boys aged between seven and ten were taken to hospital in England between 2008 and 2012 to get help for an alcohol-induced disorder. And hundreds more children were rushed to A&E because they were drunk, though not necessarily suffering from an ongoing issue with alcohol. In some of the cases it is likely the alcohol was consumed accidentally, although the data held by hospitals does not always specify this. In one worrying example of child neglect, a two-year-old boy was rushed to a hospital run by Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust last year after accidentally drinking vodka. And in another case, a baby who hadn't even turned one was hospitalised in Gloucestershire after sustaining a head injury while intoxicated with alcohol. One case reported involved a baby who was hospitalised after sustaining a head injury while intoxicated with alcohol (posed by model) The research, by the Ferrari Press Agency, revealed all five of the worst-hit hospital trusts were in the south of England - with the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust topping the list. A total of 46 drunk children aged ten or under were rushed to A&E at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading between 2008 and 2012. Two of these - a nine-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy - were admitted as in-patients to receive treatment for an alcohol-induced mental and behavioural disorder. Nick Barton, chief executive of the . charity Action on Addiction, said children who suffered from alcohol . problems were likely to have an alcoholic parent. He said: 'Children who grow up in . homes where their parents have alcohol and drug problems are seven times . more likely to develop substance misuse problems themselves. 'A recent study indicated that 22 per cent of children live with a parent who drinks hazardously. 'A particularly worrying finding was the lack of awareness among parents about the effects of their drinking on their children. 'These children are at risk in a . variety of ways, from disruption of family life, social isolation and a . threat to safety as a result of parents' alcohol related behaviour, to . the accessibility of alcohol. Often they assume the parental role.'","380 children aged 10 or under treated for intoxication over four year period .

And the nine-titles-in-a-row manager also confessed he should have walked away much sooner before he did finally quit in August 2013. The 66-year-old returned to the club in November 2012 after being appointed a non-executive director by then chief executive Green - and he was then handed the chairmanship six months later. Walter Smith has revealed he regrets not leaving the Rangers board before August 2013 . Former Rangers boss Smith has ruled out the possibility of replacing Ally McCoist . But he soon resigned as he accused the Yorkshireman and former directors Brian Stockbridge and Bryan Smart of creating a 'highly dysfunctional environment' inside the Ibrox boardroom. However, speaking at the launch of former Rangers Director of Communications Jim Traynor's new PR firm Level 5, Smith said: 'Everybody talks about it being chaotic. Everybody can make up their minds about what happened. It was chaotic enough for me to resign. 'For my own embarrassment I maybe held on a bit too long. I should have resigned long before I did. 'But that happens. It was an error on my own part to get involved.' He added: 'Would I have done anything differently? Yeah, I probably wouldn't have joined the board at all. Why? Just the way everything turned out. 'I felt at the time that if I could help the club in any way with the circumstances it was in, it was the right time to do so. 'As it turns out, after a couple of months I discovered it wasn't the right time and I had to leave. 'That was my decision and I found out the boardroom aspect was a circumstance I wasn't particularly comfortable in.' Former Scotland manager Craig Brown reckons Smith should return to Ibrox for a third stint as boss now that Ally McCoist has been put on gardening leave. Smith won 10 Scottish titles during his time at Rangers and led the Scottish side to the 2008 Uefa Cup final . Craig Brown believes Smith should return to the club as manager following the departure of McCoist . But Smith - who won 10 Scottish titles and led the Light Blues to the final of the Uefa Cup in 2008 - said: 'I will go back to Ibrox to games but not in any official capacity. 'I wouldn't go back onto the board either. I have learned it is an environment I am not particularly comfortable in.' Green has now departed the scene but chaos continues to reign at Rangers. American financier Robert Sarver has pulled the plug on takeover talks after accusing the board of ignoring his requests for dialogue. That leaves the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - and oldco director Dave King to battle it out with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for control of the Glasgow giants. Smith insists he does not know what direction the club will take next, but does reckon Park's group would unite the Ibrox faithful. He said: 'The ideal outcome would be for Rangers to get back to where they were a number of years ago, challenging for the title, as quickly as possible. That's what every Rangers fan wants. 'How they get there I don't know. 'I don't know enough about what is going on in the background at the present moment to support one and not the other. 'I just wish everybody would get together and rid Rangers of the problems we have had. 'Can Douglas Park bring stability back to club and win over the fans' trust? Of course he can. He would do that as somebody known to supporters. 'But whoever comes in has to bring that back to Rangers, whether they are American or Scottish. They have to bring an element of trust back into the club again because supporters are now showing they are unhappy with what is going on.

Others deduced the holy hog was merely seeking food or resting after an act of physical exertion. Another web user offered a more scientific explanation: the pig was suffering from a disease concerning a deficiency in vitamin E, which can lead to an inability to stand up on all fours and kneel on one's front legs. It was later revealed the 150kg pig has escaped from a nearby farm with two other cohorts in search of food . Meanwhile, the owner of the pig later revealed it had escaped his hog pen on the morning on February 22, apparently in search of food.

A sheriff's office in Lousiana is under fire from gay rights advocates for targeting men using an outdated law from the early 1800s. According to a report published Sunday in The Advocate, the East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's office has been conducting sting operations to arrest gay men looking for sex in public parks. Over the past two years the Special Community Anti-Crime Team has arrested at least 12 men under an unenforceable 'crime against nature' law deemed invalid by the U.S. Supreme Court a decade ago. Outdated: A report published in The Advocate Sunday revealed a two-year long series of sting operations in East Baton Rouge that seemed to target homosexuals in the community . Undercover officers would meet men in the park and get them to agree to have sex, and that was enough basis to arrest them under the 'crime against nature' law - R.S. 14:89 - which was put on the records book back in 1805. The statue includes language which bans 'the unnatural canal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex.' The Supreme Court struck down that part in a 2003 ruling with a similar law in Texas. Because of the Supreme Court precedent, the courts would be unable to prosecute anyone charged today with that crime. However, according to sheriff's office spokesman Casey Hicks, since the law is on the books police still have the right to enforce it. She also said the men were not targeted for their sexual orientation, but because the office had been receiving complaints about people using the parks to have public sex. Apologize: Metro councilmen John Delgado called for a public apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux . 'The issue here is not the nature of the relationship but the location,' Ms Hicks said. 'These are not bars. These are parks. These are family environments.' However, according to District Attorney Hillar Moore III, since the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 there would be no way of prosecuting any of the men charged with the crime. 'For the Sheriff's Office to be setting up these kinds of sting operations up is a waste of time because they can't prosecute these things,' said Tommy Damico who is defending one of the men arrested last month under the archaic law. Advocates in the gay rights community expressed their outrage over the series of sting operations. 'It is frustrating that people are using their resources to pursue issues like this and arrest people for attempting to pick someone up and go home with them,' said Bruce Parker of Equality Louisiana. 'It's perfectly legal, and we would have to close down every bar in Baton Rouge if that weren't the case.' Civil rights attorney Andrea Ritchie also found the operation unsettling. 'It's really unfortunate that police are continuing to single out, target, falsely arrest and essentially ruin the lives of gay men in Baton Rouge who are engaged in no illegal conduct,' Ms Ritchie said. Metro Councilman John Delgado called for an apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux to the men arrested in the operations and the rest of the parish. The Sheriff's Office seemed to partially apologize for the arrests, issuing a statement to The Advocate Sunday saying they 'should have taken a different approach' when dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the park.","The East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office set up a series of sting operations to arrest gay men in the community under an archaic law .

Companions: But Little Joshua Carnegie had to be told his 'best friend' Tic Toc the pony is missing . A mother had to break the news to her five-year-old son that his pony has been stolen after crooks failed to return it in time for Christmas. Tic Toc, an adorable white Welsh Shetland cross, disappeared from his field on December 6. The 24-year-old has little value, suffers from the ageing condition Cushings disease, and needs daily medication for dietary problems. He belongs to Catriona Carnegie whose son Joshua has grown up with him and rides him every week in the summer. Catriona, 30, and husband Andrew, 36, a business manager, could not bring themselves to tell little Joshua that his beloved Tic Toc was missing. Friends and locals offered a £6,000 reward if Tic Toc is returned to his field in Ramsey St Mary, Cambridgeshire, before Christmas. But the thieves have failed to do the honest thing - leaving the parents no choice but to break the news to Joshua. Catriona, who keeps 20 horses, said: 'Josh is absolutely devastated. 'He has grown up with Tic Toc, they are best friend. Last year he wrote a letter to Father Christmas asking him to make Tic Toc better because he knows he's on medication for his feet. 'He talks about Tic Toc all the time, he's been asking why he hasn't seen him, when he can visit him and when he can ride him. 'I didn't want to tell Josh that Tic Toc has been stolen but I've had to tell him that he's not living with us anymore. 'I said he's gone to retirement home because his feet are bad and hopefully he might come back to us. He is absolutely devastated, he's heartbroken. All we want is to have Tic Toc back for Christmas.' Tic Toc is 11 hands tall with a thick curly coat especially on his legs and a pink muzzle with black speckles. He is unshod and unfreeze-marked. When he was taken he was wearing a blue Rambo rug with purple trim. The fencing was intact and three gates to his field were shut when Catriona discovered he was missing so she is convinced he was stolen.

One in every four pounds collected in council tax in the last year has gone to funding local government pensions in England. Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions. More than half of all council tax revenue collected in Scotland went on local government pensions in 2011-12. Uncertain future: Pensions expert Michael Johnson claims the figures are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable . Scottish councils paid £1billion in employer contributions for local government pensions, yet they collected just £1.9billion in council tax. The figures, unveiled by pensions expert Michael Johnson, are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable, he said. In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, he warned that high costs and lax governance are corroding the pension scheme for council workers. This would ultimately end with council taxpayers or the Treasury being landed with the liabilities for paying pensions. Mr Johnson told the Mail: ‘The implications of how much is spent on pensions out of the council tax collected are enormous. There is going to be an absolute societal schism in the years ahead when you compare the average public sector worker to the average private sector worker. ‘The public sector worker’s benefits will on average be three times more than what the private sector employee gets.’ Unlike other public sector schemes, employees do contribute to the Local Government Pension Schemes. Huge disparity: For city of London council workers the administration management costs are £317.30 compared to just £7.60 in West Yorkshire . But an ageing population and a public sector pay freeze has eroded the value of those contributions. Experts predict that within three years the scheme will run out of cash. The weakest funds were already selling off assets just to bankroll existing pensioners. ‘With no realistic prospect of recovery, they are probably in a death spiral, heading to an unfunded status,’ Mr Johnson said. He warned that the ‘ultimate liability will probable fall on council taxpayers’. There was also a ‘quiet assumption … that one day, the Treasury will step in’. ‘Successive governments, irrespective of political hue, have, for decades, acted with irresponsible abandon when making provision for their own staff’s pensions. Pension promises have historically been worth roughly 35 per cent of salary, yet contributions have been only around 21 per cent: pure Madoff economics,’ he said, referring to the pyramid scheme which has been described as the biggest financial fraud of all time. Mr Johnson’s report highlighted the massive disparities in administration management costs: £13.70 in Nottinghamshire per member compared to £119.40 in Durham. Fund management costs were even more varied with City of London council workers paying £317.30 each compared to £7.60 in West Yorkshire. Mr Johnson called for some of the 101 pension schemes to be merged into several regional ones. The also queried why councils were paying so much to fund managers to actively invest their money when studies showed they provided little value when compared to ‘passive’ investments. The Mail understands that ministers and senior civil servants are closely scrutinising his recommendations. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘The problems identified in this report are already being addressed and many of the suggested reforms are underway and well advanced. ‘The LGPS is one of the lowest cost pension schemes in the country and we will continue to work very hard to improve performance and value for both taxpayers and pension fund members. The steps we are taking to make it possible to compare costs and performance between funds, and make merging easier for those funds that chose to do so, will secure the long-term viability of the scheme. ‘We are in the middle of a formal call for evidence on the future structure of the LGPS which is considering a number of issues including the size of funds, investment strategy, deficit management and cash-flow. That will result in a formal consultation early in the new year.’","Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions .

012deed72132ed0ae83bfc2f77a5f3714d56373b,"Tinder is set to launch its much awaited 'Tinder Plus' app allowing users to 'undo' accidental deletes in the US within weeks. The service has already been tested in the UK, but is now about to launch in the US, according to Techcrunch - with an expected price of $6.99 per month. The paid update is expected to allow allow users to search in other locations, although they may be charged extra for this. Scroll down for video . Tinder (screenshots pictured) is rolling out an 'undo' button which will let users undo swipes - letting them revisit profiles that they may have accidentally rejected. The function is due to be rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, but will require a premium subscription to Tinder Plus, which could cost up to $20 (£12.50) a month . Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app. Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left. A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. 'Both of Tinder’s mobile apps recently received updates on the respective app stores where the feature was mentioned in the app’s update text – hinting at an imminent arrival,' Techcrunch said. 'However, Tinder says that Plus is not yet being enabled for end users in the U.S. at this time – and the app’s update text descriptions will be edited to reflect this. 'Instead, the dating service says its U.S. launch is still on track for a mid-to-late March time frame.' The current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘like’ someone and left to pass. If both users like each other, they can chat and share photos with each other. Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service. The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations. While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life. CEO and President of Tinder, Sean Rad (who will be leaving the firm as CEO) told TechCrunch: ‘The most-requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on.’ Mr Rad said: ‘We often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they’ve left to go on a trip or vacation…We also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and Tinder Plus can do better at that.’ There is no date when Tinder Plus will launch in the UK and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance. Tinder says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents (62p), $4.99 (£3.10), $9.99 (£6.30), or $19.99 (£12.50) will be the best fit for consumers. ‘We want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on,’ Rad said.","Tinder is set to monetise its app by launching a Tinder Plus subscription .

Here, in the plush surroundings of Monte Carlo, stood the second best middleweight on the planet but still with no world championship belt around his waist. Lesser men have held one of those titles but for the third time the hard man from St Helen’s had come up short. Gennady Golovkin connects with a brutal right jab as Martin Murray feels the force of the unbeaten Kazakh . Murray was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant Golovkin but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round . Golovkin grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32-year-old, who successfully defended his middleweight title once more . 1) Floyd Mayweather . 2) Manny Pacquiao . 3) Wladimir Klitschko . 4) Gennady Golovkin . 5) Roman Gonzalez . 6) Guillermo Rigondeaux . 7) Tim Bradley . 8) Juan Manuel Marquez . 9) Carl Froch . 10) Canelo Alvarezg . Once again there was no shame in losing, on this occasion to the phenomenal Gennady Golovkin. Yet again the demeanour was reminiscent of Aussie great Ken Rosewall whenever he was told that he was the best tennis player never to win Wimbledon. That is a back-handed distinction which Murray remains determined to purge from his resume. ‘Golovkin is a terrific boxer,’ he acknowledged. ‘But I believe that if I fought like this against any of the other belt-holders I would have won. ‘I have to keep going. My day will come.’ There can be a badge of honour in defeat and Murray wore his in the livid scars, purple weals and black bruises on his face. He was clutching one small but worthy victory, that of extending Golovkin The Great as far as the 11th round for the first time in a career littered with the fallen bodies of his opponents. Golovkin is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet . Golovkin is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet . Prince Albert claps as Golovkin clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop Murray in the 11th . Unlike many of his predecessors, Murray kept getting up after being floored by the most destructive pound-for-pound puncher in the prize-ring. He had never been knocked down before but he dealt with the shock with typical courage. When he did so for the fourth time, after the most devastating blow of all, referee Luis Pabon wisely decreed that he need take no further punishment. That intervention may well have saved Murray to fight another day. Golovkin has ended the careers of several of his challengers and any more of those thunderous punches might have done the same to Murray. Much as would have objected, his corner should have pulled out a little earlier. The problem for Murray is that the strength, determination and no little skill which he brought to this challenge may make it as difficult for him to find opponents as it is for Golovkin. The Kazakh whose 29th victory inside the distance in 32 fights now gives him the highest knock-out ratio in middleweight history is finding unification fights against alternative belt wearers hard to come by. Miguel Cotto is one who is no hurry to meet Golovkin in the ring. Nor is he showing much enthusiasm for giving Murray his fourth title shot. The Monte Carlo crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from Murray and unstoppable power and precision from Golovkin . It may be that the man from St Helen’s, who is big for a middleweight, should move up to the super-middle division in which there are more big-money matches to be made. For the time being he will probably focus on pursuing whoever emerges from the winner of Peter Quillin and Andy Lee versus Billy Joe Saunders. ‘I’ve always wanted to clean up against the other domestic fighters,’ he says, ‘but at this stage whoever I can get I need it to be in big fights.’ They won’t come any bigger than Golovkin. Murray has protested about the draw which robbed him in his first title shot against Felix Sturm. He believes he would have been given the decision against Sergio Martinez had the fight not take place in Argentina. But there were no complaints this time. Murray showed the matured and reformed aspect of his nature when he said: ‘It was an honour to be in the ring with someone as good as Golovokin. Not only did I feel his power but he kept coming so hard and fast that it was impossible to keep him off me.’ The maestro returned the compliment: ‘It was not a surprise that he lasted to the 11th round. Murray is a good boxer, one of my toughest opponents and a very brave man.’","Martin Murray's fight was stopped in the 11th round by referee .

012f3ed0f56446afffc140e327952ed6b9faeaab,"A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink . She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons . Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops . ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’","Nikita Morrison, 13, brought Ben Shaw's Bitter Shandy to a classroom .

012fcc3657d881fec5df0bb533815485f76dd3cc,"(CNET) -- Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones, it's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well. Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes, from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030. The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant, or as its design suggests, more of a dog tag. It's been available for a while now, but we think it's still worth it. The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $39.99. Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset, the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile. The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant. Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick, the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it. All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid. They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key. The keys are all made of rubber, and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel. The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom. On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard. Also on the top is a tiny microphone. Getting the headset set up is pretty simple. Just power it on via the multifunction Call button, and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone. We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem. From there, we could play/pause tracks, skip songs, and adjust the volume, all from the Jabra BT3030. The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing. Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music, you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command.

01304eb05cf60c357fb194fdd91814e4ca38e17a,"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge in New York sentenced three men to a minimum 25 years in prison on Wednesday for plotting to detonate bombs at two Bronx synagogues and attack a military base in New York. James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives. Laguerre Payen, a fourth member of the group who was arrested and tried together with the defendants, was not in the courtroom pending a psychological evaluation. In August, the jury spent six weeks listening to the testimony and undercover tapes from an FBI informant who posed as a Pakistani militant. After eight days of deliberations in October, the defendants were convicted on seven of eight counts, including conspiracy and attempts to use and acquire weapons of mass destruction and anti-aircraft missiles. Cromitie and Williams were also found guilty of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States . In an emotional statement on Wednesday, Cromitie apologized to the people of United States, his family and friends. ""I have never been a terrorist and I never will be a terrorist and everyone here knows that,"" he said. David Williams and Onta Williams also apologized to their families and thanked supporters, and Onta apologized to the people of Riverdale. The prosecutors were pushing for life in prison for the three men. ""What these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin in court Wednesday. Members of the defense team argued during the trial that their clients were victims of entrapment.  The original sentencing was postponed from March 24 so the judge could hear defense arguments on the government's usage of a confidential informant in the case. ""The real crime in this case is that the government was allowed to do something like this,"" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, said after the sentencing.  Lawyers for the three men have said they will appeal. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon admonished the defendants for what they tried to do, calling it ""beyond despicable,"" yet she handed down the minimum sentence, calling the defendants ""thugs for hire,"" not religious or political martyrs. She praised the ""brilliant lawyering"" in the case and the defense for dedication to their clients. ""James Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams voluntarily agreed to target synagogues and military planes using what they thought were real bombs and missiles,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.

01307bfd9eda40466465b19b4cabe4dc9e936abf,"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- At least one miner is fighting acute pneumonia, two will need dental surgery, and others have skin problems or lesions in their eyes. Yet for all the 33 miners' challenges the past 69 days, trapped a half-mile underground in the San Jose mine without light, health care and other basics, those who have emerged appear surprisingly healthy, Chile's health minister said. ""Things are extraordinarily well, better than expected,"" Jaime Manalich said Wednesday. ""They really are in good condition -- emotional condition and physical condition."" After getting out of the capsule, each miner stood up and reconnected with loved ones. Some of them engaged the throngs nearby. Within minutes, though, all were placed on stretchers and whisked away to get medical care. While Manalich said ""no major problems"" have been found, all the rescued miners will be carefully monitored at a nearby hospital in the coming hours and days. Experts said some of the aftereffects of the long stay underground and quick trip to the surface -- especially mental effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or restless nights -- may be felt for years to come. The miners do not have to be flown to Copiapo Regional Hospital, Manalich said. However, officials strongly recommended it, and the miners have agreed to go, he said. Many of the miners rescued by late Wednesday afternoon had few evident medical problems, Manalich said, and dizziness was not a problem because the rescue capsule did not rotate as much as officials feared. Even so, all of the miners will be evaluated by specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists and psychologists. They are being housed in a brand-new ward that was completed two months before the August 5 collapse at the San Jose mine. The hospital has spent weeks preparing for the miners, said hospital director Hernan Rojas. ""We've been ready since Day One of this disaster,"" he said last month. Some miners may be released as early as Thursday afternoon, Manalich said, while others will stay longer at the hospital. That includes at least two men who need dental surgery and one miner, whom Manalich would not identify, who is expected to remain hospitalized through the weekend. That miner's symptoms emerged four days ago, and he was already being treated with antibiotics and improving about 24 hours before being brought to the surface, Manalich said. Besides physical maladies, in the coming days doctors will keep an eye out for nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety and claustrophobia, among other potential issues. They must be reintegrated with their families and society and deal with their sudden celebrity status and media attention. One expert has said the specter of post-traumatic stress disorder looms large. Dr. Michael Duncan, the deputy chief medical officer at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told CNN, ""The work is just beginning when the miners get out of the mine."" If the miners are given a clean bill of health, they will be released to their families. Some concerns linger due to their lack of sunlight, nutrition questions, the effects of their confinement, lack of sleep and sanitation issues. Because they have been isolated for so long, they could be more susceptible to the common cold or other viruses. Extensive precautions were taken to minimize health risks before the miners were rescued. Two Chilean Army nurses were sent down to the mine ahead of all the miners' rescue to help them prepare for their trip to the surface, Manalich said. One of them focused exclusively on the miner with pneumonia, who had an oxygen mask on his face when he came up. ""They have an anemic condition, and right now they have been sleeping less these last few days,"" Manalich said earlier Wednesday. ""They're tired and they still have long hours of waiting in order to be able to come up to the surface and to meet with their families."" The miners were switched to a liquid diet six hours before their rescue in case they vomit on the way up. Because Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne was concerned about the miners being reintroduced to sunlight abruptly, special sunglasses were sent down for the men to wear to make sure they don't suffer damage to their retinas. While underground, they were given special clothing that pulls sweat away from the body because of concern about skin infections, as well as special socks to help prevent infections like athlete's foot. They also had a series of vaccinations including a tetanus booster and flu shot. They have been exercising daily, and one miner, Yonni Barrios, is a paramedic who has been weighing his colleagues daily and taking blood tests and daily urine samples. American astronaut Jerry Linenger knows something about isolation and confinement. He says his five months in space aboard the Russian space station Mir left him weak and with bone loss. ""Down in the mines you have gravity pulling you down. There will be disorientation -- turning your head will feel like doing 100 backflips in a row,"" he said. The miners that have come up are showing slight increases in blood pressure and cardiac activity during the trip, but they recovered satisfactorily after a few minutes of rest and have not required medication, Manalich said. The health minister added later that, emotionally, he was surprised by how well the men were doing. Still, experts warn that psychological adjustments may remain a hurdle for the miners. ""These men spent 20 days totally cut off in the dark until the first bore hole was made,"" Linenger said. ""So they were in survival mode, which is tough psychologically because you are in a life-and-death situation."" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Patrick Oppmann, Saundra Young and Madison Park contributed to this report.","One miner suffering from pneumonia, two need dental surgery .

The family of a little girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago have spoken of their devastation after David Cameron ruled out any further investigation of the mystery. Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. Her parents believe military police made mistakes in the early stages of their investigation into her disappearance - but the Prime Minister has resisted calls to reopen the inquiry. Katrice's father, Richard Lee, 62, today appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family to explain why the case will not be taken forward. Mr Lee, who lives in Hartlepool, County Durham, said: 'I want to meet up with the Prime Minister and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why he isn't looking into the case any further. 'He said he was going to and then he met up with the military police, but why hasn't he asked to meet up with us and get our side?' Mr Cameron promised to look into the case last month when Tory MP Caroline Dinenage raised it during Prime Minister's Questions. Waiting for answers: Katrice's father, Richard Lee, has appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family and explain why the case will not be taken forward . But Ms Dinenage, the local MP for Katrice's mother, Sharon, of Gosport, Hampshire, received a letter from Mr Cameron stating that the case would not be reinvestigated. Refusal: Mr Cameron was urged to look into the case by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage . Mr Cameron wrote that he had reached the decision following a meeting with military police. It is another blow for Katrice's family, who have campaigned for three decades for police to release their files on the case. They claim military police have been uncooperative over the years and that mistakes were made in the hours after Katrice was reported missing. Mr Lee said: 'Things weren't done that should have been done 30 years ago and now the people who are working in the office with the Prime Minister are people who were never there in the beginning. 'Who better to speak to than us, Katrice's family?' Mr Lee has been working with Hartlepool MP Iain Wright to push for progress in the case. He said: 'I'm not going to let this issue go away. I won't give up.'","Katrice Lee went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981 .

0131c19f4124202c8b2603029b5bc642d996c851,"For Leeds Rhinos the wait is over and one of rugby league’s great peculiarities is no more. Not since 1999 had this great sporting institution celebrated a Challenge Cup Final victory. Six times they had tried in recent years and six times, remarkably, they had failed. Now, after this compelling and deserved victory over neighbours and underdogs Castleford, Brian McDermott’s team have the sport’s most cherished trophy back in their possession again. Delirious: Leeds Rhinos celebrate their first Challenge Cup trophy success in 15 years . Delighted: Brian McDermott looks over the moon after leading Leeds Rhinos to Challenge Cup success . Celebrations: Kevin Sinfield (left) and McDermott hold aloft the Tetleys Challenge Cup trophy . Big occasion: Castleford and Leeds met at Wembley for the 113th final of its type . Early lead: Tom Briscoe scores the first try of the game at Wembley . Few could argue with the result either. Leeds began well, scored an early try through winger Tom Briscoe and never really looked back. Castleford, the surprise entity of the rugby league season, railed briefly at the start of the second half and the game was alive when Oliver Holmes powered over to bring the score back to 16-10. But this was a day when Leeds always looked destined to win and it was fitting that one of the games true titans, winger Ryan Hall, scored his second try late in the game to earn himself the Lance Todd Man of the Match trophy and his team the victory. Given the enormity of the occasion and the challenge facing them, it seemed imperative that Castleford started the game well. Unfortunately for Daryl Powell’s team, they couldn’t find their rhythm and it only took Leeds a matter of minutes to score. The big Castleford prop Craig Huby – playing just two weeks after dislocating his elbow – tried to lay down something of a marker with an early hit on Kevin Sinfield but Leeds began with purpose and zest and it wasn’t a surprise when pressure build down the left allowed the favourites to move the ball across the field where centre Kallum Watkins supplied Briscoe with an invitation to dive over in the right corner. Crucial: Danny McGuire scores his side's second try of the game against Castleford . Clinical: McGuire scores his side's second try of the afternoon in the Wembley showdown against Castleford . Sinfield kicked with customary precision and calm from the touchline and Leeds were away. For a while, Castleford did show something of their true selves. Winger Justin Carney was unfortunate not to score when he went over only for referee Phil Bentham to pull play back. A minute or so later, however, Castleford were over as Daryl Clark ran on to a Marc Sneyd kick to bundle Zak Hardaker out of the way and touch down. Despite Sneyd missing a rather kickable conversion, Castleford were back in the game but it was the period between then and the interval that left them with such a long road back. Leeds, at this point, were just too precise, too reliable. Leeds’ second try was certainly a poor one from a Castleford point of view as full-back Luke Dorn stood transfixed beneath a routine Rob Burrow kick and Danny McGuire leapt above him to score. With Sinfield kicking expertly once again, this time from the left, Leeds had their noses in front and six minutes later they came up with one of the tries of which they are so capable. Seemingly pinned down on his own goal line, Hardaker somehow sprung three tackles to make 50 metres and begin a sequence that ended with Hall forcing his way past Kirk Dixon from a standing start to bundle the ball over. Euphoria: McGuire celebrates his try as he puts his team in the ascendancy before half-time . High hopes: Castleford fans look ahead to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley . It was classic play from Hall, one of Super League’s most remarkable athletes, and, despite Sinfield missing the conversion, it have Leeds a 16-4 half-time lead they never really looked like relinquishing. Castleford did find some rather belated adrenaline to feed off early in the second half and scored their second try on the back of a breakaway that saw Jamie Ellis, Dorn and Michael Shenton combine to send in the second row Holmes. On another day, Powell’s brave team may have used that score as a platform for recovery. Here, though, Leeds were not to be denied and perhaps the decisive try of the afternoon arrived with 13 minutes left. This time it was Leeds interchange Paul Aiton who did the groundwork, scurrying laterally along the ten metre line to feed Hall. Once again the big winger had everything to do as three Castleford men stood between him and the line. Seconds later, though, Liam Finn, Holmes and Weller Hauraki lay on the floor like crumpled white bed sheets as Leeds celebrated the score that means that in the pubs of places like Wigan, St Helens and Bradford they must now find something else to laugh about.","Leeds saw off their Yorkshire rivals Castleford at Wembley on Saturday .

01320e7d24406f4c858dbb205e3582681f621c31,"Rome (CNN) -- Allegations that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had sex with a teenage prostitute are ""mud"" thrown on him by political opponents who want to get rid of him, the scandal-prone politician said. ""But this time they've surpassed any limit,"" Berlusconi said in a statement. ""The mud will fall on those who use justice as a political weapon."" The ""judicial machination ... will not succeed in stopping us or in taking us away from our commitment to change the country. This time also they will not succeed,"" he said in the statement posted on his party's website Saturday. Berlusconi is under investigation for allegedly having sex with the teenager, say prosecutors in Milan, who are linking the case to prostitution activity. The teen, identified as nightclub dancer Karima El Mahrough and nicknamed Ruby, was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, from February till May. She denied ever having sex with him in an interview recorded Saturday and broadcast Sunday. She said Berlusconi was ""a person who is accused of something he has never done. ""If you want to write, then write things that are true and not these lies and bar-room gossip,"" she told journalists and prosecutors. ""If you don't like Berlusconi, then attack him with something else. Not with this taking advantage of a girl."" But she said she had received 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. She said she was a guest at several dinners he gave, but that she did not know him well. She told the prime minister, among others, that she was 24 ""because I didn't want people to know that I was a minor,"" she said in the interview broadcast on Italy's Sky TG24. The Milan prosecutor said Berlusconi is being probed for complicity in prostitution with a minor and abuse of power. Italian media reports say Berlusconi has been summoned for questioning from January 21 to 23, but it is unclear if he will answer the prosecutor's summons. The premier's attorneys called the investigation ""absurd and groundless"" and a ""grave interference"" in Berlusconi's private life. Milan prosecutors started the investigation of this case in December after the premier called police and urged the teen's release from prison. She had been arrested in May on charges of theft. Prosecutors also sent police to search the home of Nicole Minetti, a member of Berlusconi's party and a Lombardy regional council member. Berlusconi allegedly asked Minetti to serve as Ruby's tutor so the girl would be able to leave prison. Minetti is under investigation for allegedly favoring and aiding juvenile prostitution, prosecutors said. The teen is now 18 and is considered an adult. The premier has always denied having any involvement with any prostitutes or helping prostitution or having wild parties at this house. The latest investigation emerges after Italy's Constitutional Court struck down last week key parts of a law that would protect Berlusconi from prosecution. The law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court. But Italy's top court ruled that judges, not politicians, should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court. Separate trials against Berlusconi are pending. He's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another. Both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed. Berlusconi has called the charges politically motivated. A third case against the prime minister, also related to tax fraud, is in preliminary stages. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994, but he remains very popular with the Italian public.

0132a4a7b0ae6842a36af6eff1dfdaf8f2beb3a0,"Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown may have been slightly premature when he queried whether Radamel Falcao's lifeless outing at Deepdale on Monday night could have been his last in a Manchester United shirt. The misfiring Colombian is on loan at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and United have a £43million option to make the deal permanent. But here are 10 reasons why they should not. Radamel Falcao was hauled off on the hour mark after yet another poor display for Manchester United . Falcao, pictured with Wayne Rooney on Monday night, has managed only four goals form 19 matches . It was another disappointing night for Falcao as he failed to complete the 90 minutes against Preston . Because he is not worth it... When you pay £6m to loan someone and then stump up £285,000-a-week in wages you expect something substantial in return. That has simply not happened. Even given United's spending power and windfalls from the adidas partnership and new TV deal this is a player who, so far, has not done anything to show why they should splash out £43m to secure his services permanently. Falcao is replaced by Ashley Young with United losing 1-0. They went on to win the fifth-round tie 3-1 . Lies, damn lies and statistics... A Scots poet once said that statistics are used like a drunk uses a lamppost – for support and not illumination. However, they present a compelling case when it comes to the Colombian. With a paltry four goals in 19 games, Falcao has completed 90 minutes on a mere five occasions. At Deepdale, an hour yielded no shots on or off target, no assists and the grand total of 18 passes. The Colombian international made his way to the touchline once he realised his number was being held up . That miss against West Ham... Falcao can justifiably point to a lack of chances during his stint in a United shirt. The free-flowing red marauders of recent years now seem a distant memory as Louis van Gaal's men struggle to create openings. However, at Upton Park he was given a glorious opportunity. Clean through and with only the keeper to beat Falcao failed to control and prodded a tame volley wide. It was the kind of opportunity you would have expected him to relish and summed up a miserable season. Falcao spurned a brilliant chance against West Ham which summed up his disappointing season at United . Powerless at Preston... You would have thought Falcao, a man who has shone on the biggest stages, would have been licking his lips at a trip to a League One side. Not so much. Over the course of a difficult hour he failed to trouble an admittedly hard-working and physical third-tier backline and it surprised nobody apart from himself when he was hooked to gleeful cries of 'What a waste of money' from the home support. Impact on the rest of the team... It is just not working. Look at Monday night. After 60 minutes United were a goal down and heading for their earliest end to a hunt for honours in a season for 28 years. One-paced and one-dimensional, they were playing into burly Preston's hands. Off came Falcao, replaced by Ashley Young, and almost immediately they were playing with width and pace on their way to scoring three goals. This was not the first time Falcao's withdrawal has had a positive impact - something that will not have bypassed the meticulous Van Gaal. Ashley Young celebrates with Marouane Fellaini after the big Belgian fired United into the lead at Preston . Fellaini struck in the second half as Man United completed their comeback against the League One side . Injury doubts persist... This, simply put, is not the same player as the goal machine who succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury last January. He is not sharp and still seems desperately short of match fitness. Falcao has now made 19 appearances for United - will he will ever regain the sharpness that made him one of European football's hottest properties? Jorge 'mouth' Mendes... The so-called super agent is an influential man and one who has a longstanding relationship with United. But when he starts criticising the manager you have to wonder if he needs reminding of who pays the bills. Earlier this month Mendes made the bold claim that Falcao would be firing at United if Sir Alex Ferguson was still manager. With that latest attack he may have sealed his client's fate. Agent Jorge Mendes appeared to suggest that Falcao would have had more success with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson rather than under the current regime of Louis van Gaal . Not what United need... Van Gaal's relatively late arrival at Old Trafford meant that, for the second summer in a row, there was a lack of proper planning behind the club's moves in the transfer window. As a result, the Dutchman appears to have ended up with pieces from separate jigsaws. He knows that United need pace up front – that's why he's started untested rookie James Wilson ahead of Falcao more than once. With targets already identified for this summer United will not make the same mistakes twice. Falcao, pictured here during his side's 0-0 draw at Cambridge, appears to be short on confidence . Confidence issues... When you own a gold-plated mobile phone, pick up £285,000-a-week and have God-like status in your homeland you would imagine confidence is not an issue. But for Falcao it clearly is. The pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world coupled with the feeling that this season is a test created by the £43m clause appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders.

Commons Speaker John Bercow has been called a ‘little weasel’ by a mother who reported him to police for allegedly ‘walloping’ her car. Nathalie Pulford dismissed the MP as an ‘arrogant toff’ after watching him try to squeeze his Volvo into a tight parking spot in Chelsea. The 42-year-old divorcee had been dining with her father and two sons, aged ten and 12, when she saw Mr Bercow attempting to manoeuvre his vehicle into a small space near her Range Rover. Rebuttal: Mr Bercow's spokesman said today that he would happy for Ms Pulford to take the matter up with his insurer . She believed she saw her luxury car move so ran outside the restaurant to tell off the Speaker. Mr Bercow denied pranging her car and said he had been offended by her behaviour. Miss Pulford, who has reported Wednesday evening’s incident to police, said she asked Mr Bercow if it was his Volvo and he said it was. ‘I asked him if he realised that he’d just bashed both cars to get in his spot and he said, “No I didn’t” so I replied “Yes you did because I was just watching you”. ‘He was not willing to discuss it and was completely dismissive of me. I stood there absolutely dumbfounded. ‘I said, “If you didn’t touch these cars how about you prove me wrong and get out without touching them?” and he said, “I will do no such thing” and “I am not required to leave this space therefore I won’t do it”.

Difference of opinion: Natalie Pulford claims John Bercow's Volvo struck her Range Rover but he says that he didn't . Indignant: Nathalie Pulford charged out of a Chelsea restaurant and said to the MP: 'Don't you realise you absolutely bashed into my car?' ‘I felt such a fool because something quite trivial had become out or proportion. 'If he’d have turned round and said sorry I wouldn’t have asked him to pay for it, but he kept looking at me square in the eyes and said, “I didn’t do it”. If I’d have seen how bad the damage was I’d have asked for his details.’ She said Mr Bercow’s car was covered in scrapes and scratches. Accusations: Natalie Pulford says 'he was being . really haughty, being a completely arrogant toff', but he says 'she was . clearly very irate, but I totally reject any suggestion (about) the . scratches on her car ' In the gap: Ms Pulford stands between her Range Rover and the Speaker's Volvo, which she said hit her vehicle and another in a tight manoeuvre . ‘He should have left a note on the window – that’s what I would have done. 'It’s disgraceful. He’s a little weasel. 'Everyone has bad days but it would be nice if he gave me an apology or just admitted it. 'Witnesses saw it happen. How can anybody be so conceited? I am sure he thinks he’s above the law.’ Mr Bercow admitted to a reporter at the scene that he was ‘not the best driver’ but insisted: ‘Am I too arrogant to say sorry? No. I’d be happy to fess up, but the fact is I didn’t touch her car. I don’t know why she got so angry.’ Scene: The incident happened on Sloane Avenue in Chelsea outside the Gaucho restaurant on the right .

He was simply bewildered at the time.’ It is claimed that a waitress at Gaucho backed Ms Pulford's version of events. Nadia . Green said: 'I saw the bump.

0134b852198cd1f0463447397944dd90ad913b14,"Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- Quick: Name the governor of Alaska. Nope, not Sarah Palin. He's no reality TV star. Isn't on anyone's list of 2016 presidential candidates. And the local press thinks he's so bland they call him the ""Oatmeal Governor."" But Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell deserves national name-recognition for one reason: He's taking on one of the most important issues of our time. He's trying to get Alaska to talk about the ""resident evil"" of rape. ""It's culturally permissible to be silent about it,"" and that must change, Parnell told me in a recent interview at the governor's office in Juneau. (You commissioned that trip, by the way, as part of CNN's Change the List project. More on that here.) For years, this state -- which has the highest reported rate of rape in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates -- denied it had a problem. Politicos and advocates said maybe Alaskans reported rape more often than people in other states -- but, gosh, it couldn't be a bigger problem here than elsewhere, could it? Related: The rapist next door . Parnell has helped end that era of senseless denial. In our interview, he called violence against women an ""epidemic."" Like an alcoholic must admit he has a problem in order to face it, he told me, the governor of the state with the highest rape rate must, too, fess up to the problem in order to solve it. ""I can't wave a wand and solve alcoholism, I can't wave a wand and solve domestic violence, but I can work to create a climate where it's culturally permissible to speak about these things with our family and friends, get people to help who cross our paths, to stand up for those who are being abused and hurt,"" he said. ""To me that's a win in the end."" True enough. The cornerstone of Parnell's campaign is his ""Choose Respect"" initiative, which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from Palin. Now nearing the end of his first full term and seeking re-election in 2014, Parnell, a Republican, oversees a state that has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention at a time when the overall state budget is shrinking. The ""Choose Respect"" program would receive $12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor's proposed budget were approved. That's only 0.1% of the total proposed budget, but it's still considerable. The laid-back 51-year-old governor, who looks like a kinder version of Sean Hannity plus Vladimir Putin, was born in California but moved to Anchorage at age 10, according to a biography on the Republican Governors Association website. His dad was in the Army and later served in the state legislature. Parnell, an attorney, once worked as a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas interests. He served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to Palin. Even liberals in the state, like Caren Robinson, who started the first women's shelter in Juneau, praise the fact that he has supported addressing domestic violence and rape since the 1990s as a member of the legislature. Parnell was elected to the Alaska House at age 29. I disagree with some of Parnell's policies -- he's not giving enough autonomy to Native Alaskan communities and courts, for instance, which may be well poised in some cases to handle cases of sexual and gender-based violence; his decision to block part of Obamacare is unwise; and, despite substantial efforts to change things, parts of the state is so remote they're almost totally lawless, which leads people to rape and abuse with a sense of near-impunity. The lawless 'end of the land' But the governor's efforts to get Alaska to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves. No policy will be able to fix this problem as long as silence and shame surround rape and abuse. Someone's got to speak up. I saw some results of the ""Choose Respect"" program firsthand: . â€¢ In Juneau, I met members of the Thunder Mountain High School basketball team, which participates in a program called Coaching Boys into Men. The team's coach, John Blasco, talks with his players regularly about healthy dating relationships and respect for women. A star shooting guard, Matt Seymour, 18, told me there have been instances when he's told teammates not to use demeaning language about women because of what he learned as part of the program. â€¢ In one small town in southwest Alaska, I met young people who are learning about the Yupik Eskimo culture in after-school programs at the Tundra Women's Coalition, which receives funding from the state. The idea is that traditional culture can strengthen society and, ultimately, reduce rates of sexual assault. I also met women who were flown into a shelter run by the coalition from outlying villages that are not connected to road systems. â€¢ Across Alaska, I saw the power of a statewide survey analyzed by the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center, and funded by the state. The survey effectively ended debate about whether Alaska has a problem with domestic violence and sexual assault, said Andre Rosay, director of the center. The 2010 survey of 871 adult women found 37% had suffered sexual violence and 59% had been the victim of sexual violence and/or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. ""It was shocking and distressing for many people"" to see how common violence against women really was in Alaska, said Lauree Morton, executive director of the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, a state-funded agency. That survey also has spurred change. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska . Alaska shouldn't have needed those shocking numbers in order to act, but they do underscore the need for urgent action, and that information has won converts. Parnell told me he is convinced Alaska can change in part because his own grandfather was verbally and physically abusive to his family. But violence stopped with Parnell's father, who was never violent, he said. ""That gives me hope for the future of our country, when I see people taking that responsibility to live larger than what they've been taught,"" the governor said. Parnell is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts Alaska and should not be tolerated. The state promotes a series of ""Choose Respect"" marches, which were organized in more than 140 communities across the state last year and will be held again in the spring. Those rallies help create a climate where ""more people come to safety and more people are willing to speak about the unspeakable,"" Parnell said. ""That's been the hardest part about the evil among us: We haven't been willing to talk about it,"" the governor added. ""The 'Choose Respect' initiative has given Alaskans permission to speak about these things."" Meet Alaska's pioneer woman . He added: ""I'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame. They do not need to carry the guilt and shame -- and we are willing to embrace and love them unconditionally."" Parnell would like the ""Choose Respect"" campaign to spread across the country. He told me sports figures, in particular, have the power to raise awareness about ending sexual violence. ""This is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people,"" he said. ""To have a nation where every person lives free of fear ... and every person has that hope and opportunity for the future, that's my dream. But it's going to take everybody -- it's going to take 'real-deal' heroes standing up and speaking out and giving people permission to speak about this."" Those ""real-deal heroes"" should include people like Sarah Palin, the woman still more associated with the governorship in the American public's mind than Parnell. And -- forget celebrity -- they should include you, too.

0134e69ba90fea45f72677e65a1002a7dd943bbd,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The recovery of a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the neck and now breathes on a ventilator hinges on what happens over the next two days. Malala Yousufzai remains in a Rawalpindi hospital after being attacked for simply defending the right of girls to go to school. And police are questioning men with alleged links to the attack. On Friday, an international team of neurological specialists said her condition was stable, but they were watching her closely. Her family waits, and hopes, yet they are afraid to give away where they are exactly. They're terrified that Taliban who would gun down a teenager wouldn't hesitate to come after them. Around the country, supporters gathered for small vigils to pray for her recovery. Government officials in Peshawar, the main city in the northwestern region where Malala is from, were silent for one minute in her honor. Tests on Malala went well, doctors said, and her care at a hospital where she was initially treated was good. She remains in critical condition, but specialists are satisfied with the situation. ""The next 36 to 48 hours are important,"" Major Gen. Asim Bajwa told reporters in Rawalpindi. A Karachi rally is planned for Sunday, and thousands of people are expected to attend. Malala was riding home in a school van Tuesday in the tense and Taliban-heavy Swat Valley when gunmen jumped into the vehicle and demanded to know which girl she was. Her horrified classmates pointed to her, and the men fired. Two other girls were wounded, but not seriously. Brave blogger . Malala gained fame for blogging about how girls should have rights in Pakistan, including the right to learn. She spoke out in a region of the country where support for Islamic fundamentalism runs high. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a CNN interview last year. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Malala, whose writing earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, also encouraged young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment where were you when your people were asking you ... when your school fellows were asking you, and when your school was asking you,"" she said in her CNN interview, ""['Why] I am being blown up?'"" The Taliban believes no girl should be educated, and they've threatened that if Malala survives, they will murder her. Despite the threat, some Pakistani schoolgirls are saying Malala's shooting won't stop them from continuing their education. ""In our society, girls don't have rights and they don't get to study, but I think that's completely wrong,"" one of the girls told a CNN reporter. ""I think we have the same rights as men and we will stand up for our rights. And we will go out and encourage all girls to study."" Police make arrests, close in on attackers . Police had earlier detained 200 suspects, but released all but three. Those three gave statements pointing to one suspect. Also Friday, police officer Gul Afzal Afridi said that suspect has not been arrested, but investigators said they strongly believe he played a role in the attack. Though many Pakistanis are appalled by the attack, the Taliban have kept up their vicious comments, saying that they figured shooting the teenager would have an impact in the West. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan said. 'Malala is Pakistan's daughter' Indeed, the attack did stir global debate. Leaders across the world spoke out, including those in Pakistan. The teenager has come to symbolize a battle between freedom and oppression, violence and peace, a young generation and a group that is hell-bent on keeping Pakistan under the grip of Islamic extremism. ""Malala is Pakistan's daughter, Pakistan's real face, Pakistan's messenger of love and peace,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said. The country is fighting terrorism because it's a ""menace."" On her blog, Malala often wrote about her life in Swat Valley, a hotbed of militant activity. The valley near the Afghanistan border once attracted tourists to Pakistan's only ski resort, as well as visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered -- unleashed a wave of violence. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. ""We have sacrificed, both man and material and our valiant armed forces, innocent children, citizens, workers and leaders,"" Ashraf said Friday. ""But now the nation is united and we have to unite and stand together to uproot this menace from our motherland and our children."" Speaking in Rawalpindi, Ashraf thanked political leaders and others who have stood up in support of Malala. ""We would together like to give this message to fight against the mindset that attacked her,"" he said. 'Education is the best thing' At Islamabad's Khaldunia High School, students hung banners and wrote letters demanding that the government do everything possible to save Malala. Girls look up to Malala, said one female student whose identity CNN isn't revealing to protect her safety. ""I was really shocked because she was so ambitious ..."" she said. ""I pray for her health."" ""To have the courage to actually go against all that,"" another girl said. ""I think that was quite respectable."" A reporter asked if the attack has inspired them and if they planned to speak up even louder. ""I want these people who attacked her to learn that women are not all bad,"" one girl answered. ""They are basically afraid of giving women equal rights because they're afraid of what women can do because they know they can do a lot. ""I want to speak up so they can learn some lessons from that message."" A boy student said he wanted to study more because of Malala. He won't take going to school for granted anymore, he said. ""What I learned from her is that education is the best thing, and if I get an education, I will be a better person,"" said another boy, 14. A 'barbaric act' President Asif Ali Zardari told Malala's father Friday that he was grieving and in shock over her shooting, and he condemned ""the barbaric act of the militants,"" according to a release from Zardari's office. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar on Thursday called the attempted assassination of Malala ""a wake-up call"" for the nation. Pakistani media reports suggested that the government is considering sending her overseas for treatment, but Bajwa, the military spokesman, said Friday that there is no plan yet to do that. Media inside Pakistan continue to debate how to respond to Malala's shooting. ""Just as the Taliban scare us with terror, we must scare them by making them unable to operate,"" Madiha Afzal, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland who grew up in Pakistan, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Express Tribune. ""We must terrorize them by investing more than ever before in educating girls,"" she said. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, now the U.N. special envoy for global education, has traveled to Pakistan and advocated for girls' education there. He said in an editorial published Friday that Zardari has invited him to return in November to lead a delegation of education leaders to come up with ways to improve opportunities for children. ""I have asked Pakistan's President Zardari to pledge that Malala's suffering will not be in vain,"" he wrote. Education a focus on International Day of the Girl .

Shalikar said the Israel Defense Forces ""never received any official statement from any source"" regarding injuries to Shakoura or his relatives. ""The IDF wishes to convey that missiles are being fired at Israeli civilians from terrorists, and it has no intention of harming civilians when it returns fire at terrorists,"" he said.

The revelations have made the headlines in Germany echoing the scandal surrounding early 90s lip-syncing pop-sensation Milli Vanilli.

Kastelruther Spatzen, from the German-speaking . province of South Tyrol in northern Italy, were defended by their . manager who said using studio musicians were 'common practice'. 'The success of this band is based on a . giant fraud,' former producer Walter Widemair told Bild newspaper. He said that only the lead singer's voice was genuine on the albums and called for the group to return their prices. 'The band of fakes must give back their Echo awards,' he said. Kastelruther Spatzen's manager Helmut Brossmann said that  it was common practice for folk music bands to use studio musicians for their albums. In his defence of the popular folk-music band, he said Kastelruther Spatzen had even listed the studio musicians on their albums.

Real thing: Their former producer said lead singer Norbert Rier, seen here accepting a Folk Music award in Germany earlier this year, was the only 'genuine' voice on the albums . In a statement on the band's website Mr .

Backlash: David Cameron has been criticised by aid charities for his decision to divert millions of pounds towards military operations . Aid money should be spent on ‘schools, not soldiers’, charities said last night – as David Cameron faced a backlash over moves to divert hundreds of millions of pounds to the Armed Forces. Charities reacted with alarm after the Prime Minister revealed he wants to use part of the vast aid budget to help pay for military peacekeeping operations. But former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth hailed a ‘welcome first step’ and said security was an ‘essential precursor to the provision of aid’. The move will help protect the Armed Forces from further spending cuts and also help the Department for International Development (DfId) spend a 30 per cent budget increase due in April. Mr Cameron’s plan was warmly welcomed by Tory MPs who have raised increasing concern about the policy of cutting back defence spending while pouring billions more into foreign aid. But aid charities warned diverting money was potentially a major backward step. Oxfam’s head of policy, Max Lawson, said the aid budget should be spent on ‘hospitals and not helicopter gunships’. He went on: ‘The millions of people up and down the country who support the fantastic stance the Government is taking, protecting the aid budget when every other G8 nation is not doing that – they expect this to be spent on schools and not soldiers. ‘So we cannot see any penny diverted into the military.’ However Sir Gerald Howarth said: . ‘Britain’s armed forces contribute enormously to the provision of . security and capacity building, which are essential precursors to the . provision of aid and it is entirely appropriate to make those changes. ‘I have not come across a single . Conservative who is in favour of increasing aid at a time when we are . cutting the Armed Forces so this is a very welcome first step.’ Spending: The Prime Minister revealed yesterday how he wants to use part of the aid budget to offset cuts to the defence budget . Clash: The head of policy at Oxfam Max Lawson, left, criticised David Cameron's plan but the move was welcomed by former defence minister Gerald Howarth, right . And Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army officer, said security and overseas aid were ‘inextricably linked’. Downing Street insisted the switch would not affect Mr Cameron’s controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s total income on aid. Money will be spent on peacekeeping and conflict prevention work rather than weapons, so should still count towards the target. The new approach means aid cash could be used to pay for troop training in Mali, demobilisation in Afghanistan and providing assistance to rebel fighters in Syria. Much of the money could be channelled through the ‘conflict pool’ - a joint initiative between DfId, the MoD and the Foreign Office. Overall aid spending will rise in April as the percentage of Britain’s income spent on foreign aid rises from 0.56 per cent to hit the 0.7 target. Meeting the target will require an increase from £8.65billion to £11.3billion in the coming year – a rise of more than 30 per cent.","Money should be spent on 'schools not soldiers' says head of Oxfam .

Dozens of objects recovered from the ruins of Roman cities Pompeii and Herculaneum will go on show outside Italy for the first time at a new exhibition at the British Museum. The two cities on the Bay of Naples were wiped out by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The show will feature objects found in their ruins including jewellery, carbonised food and a baby’s crib that still rocks on its curved runners. An employee of the British Museum holds a colourful fragment of wall painting unearthed from the destroyed Roman city of Pompeii, which is set to go on display outside Italy for the first time. Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, in AD 79. Just after midday on August 24, . fragments of ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris began pouring down . on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and . causing the roofs of many houses to fall in. Curator Paul Roberts said the 250 objects would illustrate the domestic lives of the population and show the 'different halves of this amazing story'. He said: 'These are not extraordinary cities, they die in an extraordinary way, but they are ordinary cities in Roman terms. 'That’s why they are so important because we can look at them and say we have a pretty good idea what was going on in other Roman cities.' Mr Roberts said the 400 to 500 centigrade volcanic avalanche that buried Herculaneum had preserved many objects including furniture and food. He said: 'It was buried in a different way from Pompeii and the effect of that as this cloud of superheated gas and debris swirled around the houses of Herculaneum it carbonised, it turned into charcoal wood, leather and even food.' Six pieces of carbonised furniture, including the crib, will be lent to the British Museum in what Mr Roberts said was 'a world first'. He said there would also be “a loaf of bread that was put in the oven in AD79 and came out in the 1930s” complete with the namestamp of the slave who baked it. Other exhibits include peppercorns rescued from the drains, carbonised figs, a lamp and wall paintings. A a plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79 that will go on show .

Also on show will be the body casts . of six people, including a family of two adults and two children who . died huddled together under the steps of their villa, and a pet dog. Mr Roberts said: 'The exhibition . isn’t about death, you had to have the death of the cities in order to . bring them to life again, but the exhibition is all about the life of . these people. 'Domestic life is something we all share. 'We don’t all go to the baths, we don’t all go to the amphitheater - but we all have a home,' he said. The exhibition, which is sponsored by . Goldman Sachs, is a collaboration with the Archaeological . Superintendency of Naples and Pompeii, which is responsible for the . remains of the two cities.

Rampage: John Richards was jailed for smashing up a 103-inch TV, worth up to £45,000, in Britain's 'best sports pub' A hammer-wielding businessman has been jailed for smashing up a £45,000 TV in Britain's 'best sports pub' as customers prepared to watch one of the key matches of the football season. John Richards destroyed the 103-inch flat-screen set during a drunken rampage in which he also hit a customer on the head, damaged a cheaper TV, smashed a window, and made a hole in a wall. When police arrested him and asked how drunk he had been on a scale of one to 10, the 44-year-old replied: ‘12.’ Richards, who runs a computing recycling firm, had spent the day drinking after collecting post from his former business premises near the Globe pub, in Chichester, West Sussex. But as he walked past the pub at about 6.15pm he thought the manager was laughing at him, Chichester Crown Court heard. He then returned to his old office to collect a hammer before heading to the pub 'intent' on causing damage. The pub, which was named National Sports Pub of the Year at the Great British Pub Awards 2011, was filling up with customers when the attack happened on April 18. They had gathered to watch Chelsea beat Barcelona 1-0 in a tense Champions League semi-final clash. Richards had previously been barred from the pub, but his ban expired only a week before the incident. Prosecutor Nicola Fleck said: 'Mr Richards had previously been in some trouble with the pub and had been banned for 18 months. 'When the pub manager, Roger Nessling, saw him in the pub he asked him why he was there. Smashed: Cracks stretch from the point on the TV screen where a drunken Richards used his hammer . Cracked: Richards told police that he could not remember putting his hammer through the television screen . 'After being spoken to, Mr Richards walked towards a 103-inch wall-mounted television with a hammer in his hand and smashed it.' Ms Fleck said that Richards began swearing and added: ‘I will do six months for this but I will shut the pub down in three.’ The prosecutor said: 'The television is one of only 10 of its size in the country and is worth between £35,000 and £45,000. 'He then approached a smaller TV which was broken with a hammer. Remedy: Pub staff covered the damaged plasma TV with a white sheet so it can be used as a projection screen . Destruction: The window of a door in the pub is boarded up after being smashed in a hammer blow . 'He continued to abuse Mr Nessling and most concerning, he said he was going to be killed.'As Richards left the pub, he prodded the hammer into the back of customer Kevin Church's head, the court heard. Richards told Mr Church, who was at the bar: ‘If I see you drinking in here again I will kill you’. Ms Fleck said: 'That caused a lump and some discomfort for Mr Church. 'Mr Church said it was completely unprovoked, he had looked away to avoid trouble and was scared. 'Mr Nessling said he was fearful for his staff and customers’ safety. 'In police interview Mr Richards admitted the criminal damage but said he did not remember the assault.' Hole: The pub's smaller wall-mounted television, which was also damaged by Richards in his drunken state . Police showed Richards CCTV of the incident and he accepted it was him. 'He said on a scale of drunkeness of one to ten, he was a 12,' Ms Flack said. 'He added that Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and he was provoked.' He told a probation officer there was a history of animosity between him and Mr Nessling and he went into the pub because he thought Mr Nessling had laughed and 'made facial expressions' when he passed by, the court heard. Shocked: Pub landlady Sharon Chittock said customers were 'frozen stiff with fear' He went to the pub with the hammer because he thought Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and 'making facial expressions' as he passed by that afternoon, the court heard. Emek Yagmur, defending, said Richards was 'remorseful'. She added: 'He realises it what he did was extremely stupid and he let himself down. He lost his temper. 'He should be given credit for his very early guilty plea at the police station.' Jailing Richards for a total of six months, Judge Claudia Ackner described the rampage as an 'extremely frightening episode' with 'gratuitous damage'. She added: 'It was fortunate Mr Church did not suffer more serious damage during your unprovoked attack on him.' Richards, from Fishbourne, West Sussex, admitted four counts of criminal damage and one charge of assault by beating. The hammer was forfeited and Richards was banned from licensed premises for two years. Speaking before the case came to court, the pub's landlady, Sharon Chittock, 40, said: 'Our customers and staff were frozen stiff with fear when he pulled the hammer out from his sleeve. 'There was no stopping or reasoning with him as he just smashed it once straight through the screen. The TV was destroyed. 'We were starting to get busy and the atmosphere was building ahead of the Chelsea game. 'We were left with a lot of disappointed customers who had to crowd around a smaller screen to watch the game instead.'

0138881de84d4cb5d45169f6b3b093fdf3adb20c,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The day I interviewed Neil Diamond, he was sitting in a little room to the side of a studio, and a makeup artist was smacking him in the face with a powder puff. He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee. Neil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award. It was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as ""Cherry Cherry,"" ""Song Sung Blue"" and ""Sweet Caroline."" Ours was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up. He had slipped a black button-down shirt over his T-shirt, and suddenly he looked like Neil Diamond -- the same Neil Diamond who next week will be feted by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year,"" joining an elite club that includes Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Sting, Bono and Quincy Jones. He's working on a follow-up to last year's CD, the Rick Rubin-produced ""Home Before Dark"" -- which earned Diamond his first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. That album came after 2005's ""12 Songs,"" also produced by Rubin, which re-invigorated his recording career. As for live performance, he's rarely had problems filling arenas -- but he remembers when he did.  Watch Diamond talk about giving back » . CNN: The man in black. This has become quite the trademark. Neil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back. CNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, ""I'm singing -- listen!"" Diamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, ""You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen."" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, ""All right, let's sing together."" [chuckles] . CNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in $60 million in ticket sales.] . Diamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun. CNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous? Diamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show. CNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars. Diamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help. And I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it. So we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund. CNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you? Diamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring. I missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, ""I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television."" I missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road. CNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year."" Diamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful. CNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience? Diamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there. CNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out? Diamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been. CNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU. Diamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days. CNN: So this is definitely much better. Diamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world. CNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations? Diamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.","Neil Diamond to receive Recording Academy's Person of the Year honor .

The incident took place at the town of Kot Radha Kishan, some 40 miles southwest of the city of Lahore, and is the latest example of mob violence against minorities accused of blasphemy. A police officials told AFP: 'A mob attacked a Christian couple after accusing them of desecration of the holy Koran and later burnt their bodies at a brick kiln where they worked. Pakistani security officials have been placed on high alert since the married couple were killed near Lahore . A mob accused the couple of desecrating a copy of the Koran who then beat them and threw them into a kiln .

Another police official confirmed the incident. The victims were only identified by their first names, Shama and Shehzad, and were a married couple. Pakistan's brick kiln workers are often subject to harsh practices, with a study by the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan estimating that 4.5 million are indentured labourers. Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has constituted a three-member committee to fast track the investigation of the killings and ordered police to beef up security at Christian neighbourhoods in the province.

Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in the majority Muslim country, with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence. Anyone convicted, or even just accused, of insulting Islam, risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes. A Christian woman has been on death row since November 2010 after she was found guilty of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed during an argument with a Muslim woman.

0139524211de51f23bed66156da66d61abeef0b1,"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . A description of John Kerry by Isis as an ‘uncircumcised old geezer’ is further evidence of British involvement in the militant organisation, a terrorism expert has said. The comment about the U.S Secretary of State came in an audio recording by Isis spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani. He said: 'The uncircumcised old . geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist, issuing a verdict to the . people that the Islamic State was distorting Islam, that what it was . doing was against Islamic teachings, and that the Islamic State was an . enemy of Islam.' Connection: The use of the word 'geezer' in the translation of al-Adnani's description of John Kerry is yet more evidence of strong ties between Britain and Isis, according to an expert . Professor Anthony Glees, head of the . centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of . Buckingham, said the use of British slang was hugely significant. He told MailOnline: ‘I'd say the use of . the word ""geezer"" is a massively important further giveaway about the . identity of some of these Isis thugs. It's a term most usually heard in . London. 'So Isis have drawn us, I'd suspect intentionally, back towards reflecting on the fact that Brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers, taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world.' His comments came as experts revealed that the terrorist group is using its control of oil fields to fund its brutal operations. Britain's link to Islamic State became known around the world after shocking videos showed a British man known as 'Jihadi John' executing American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, as well as British aid worker David Haines, 44. Some sources believe that Jihadi John comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London. Professor Glees added: 'It's my understanding that MI5 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of ""John"" but that like the UK government more generally they don't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us, not so much out of consideration to ""John's"" family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here, and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it.' Low blow: The group called John Kerry an 'uncircumcised old geezer' after his comments that the terrorist organization 'did not represent Islam' in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . It was made as a fuller picture emerged of Isis's vast wealth - estimated to be around $1.5billion - and slick operation. One Syrian told the Financial Times that he had a job interview with Isis to work in its media centre in Raqqa, Syria's capital, and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal. The man, who turned the job down, said: 'They offered me $1,500 a month [five times the average Syrian salary], plus a car, a house and all the cameras I needed. I remembered looking around the office. It was amazing the equipment they had in there.' The U.S is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group's money is coming from. Barack Obama and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week's annual United Nations General Assembly. And a new U.S-based research group called the Counter Extremism Project is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters. It's convinced that Isis is generating a great deal of wealth from shady deals with morally compromised companies. Risk management group Maplecroft believes that Isis controls half a dozen oil fields in Syria and four in Iraq, with many officials convinced it's making millions from smuggling barrels to Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The group is also known to make money from kidnappings, extortion and robbery. More airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in these strikes, though she would not say what countries. These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Obama. In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.","Isis called John Kerry an 'uncircumcised geezer' in an audio recording .

013b4d8104c422222344bc8263022820e6524ad1,"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ""Zeitoun"" by Dave Eggers, a nonfiction account of a Syrian-American immigrant and his extraordinary experience during Hurricane Katrina. Eggers is the author of five other books, including ""What Is the What,"" a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. Eggers is the founder and editor of McSweeney's, an independent publishing house based in San Francisco. Dave Eggers writes that Abdulrahman Zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the Syrian coast as Katrina approached. (CNN) -- FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005 . On moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon. The fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning. Abdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this. And when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in. They would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings. Abdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free. Thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed. Kathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life. The phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail. Kathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next. ""Zeitoun Painting Contractors,"" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows. ""Sure, of course,"" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease. This was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention. ""We'll have a crew over this afternoon,"" Kathy told the woman. Kathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.","Dave Eggers: Abdulrahman Zeitoun grew up in a Syrian fishing town .

013c80b65c2b177ab3d6508dd951e71e2618b72a,"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- For more than a decade, Robin Emmons felt helpless as her older brother lived on the streets, eating out of garbage cans. She tried repeatedly to get him help for his mental illness, but authorities told her there was nothing they could do. After he was arrested in 2008 for damaging someone's car during a schizophrenic outburst, she was finally able to become his legal guardian and get him into a halfway house with psychiatric services. But as she watched his mental health improve, she noticed his physical health getting worse. ""I learned that he was becoming borderline diabetic,"" she said. ""He wasn't like that even when he was homeless."" She investigated and found out that the nonprofit facility was mainly feeding him packaged and canned foods because it couldn't afford fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I had a small garden, so I thought, 'Well, I'll just put in some extra rows,' "" Emmons said. ""I began making weekly deliveries of whatever was coming up."" She soon realized, however, that the problem extended well beyond her brother's transitional home. While farmers markets were springing up across the city, she noticed that low-income and working-class neighborhoods had few grocery stores or places to buy fresh produce. ""If you don't live in an affluent part of the city ... your easiest options are the dollar menu or the convenience store attached to a gas station,"" said Emmons, 45. For residents who lacked transportation, buying healthy food was even more difficult. ""It might be a trek, or they might have to borrow a car or get on a bus,"" Emmons said. ""Often, once they get there, they are paying a very high price for the food."" A recent study from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte confirmed her impressions. It showed that more than 72,000 low-income city residents, many of them minorities, lived in ""food deserts"" -- areas without a supermarket with fresh food nearby. They also faced a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Access to fresh food is an issue for many communities throughout the United States. According to the Department of Agriculture, nearly 10% of the U.S. population lives in low-income areas more than a mile from a supermarket. Discovering this problem sparked something inside Emmons, who had recently left her corporate job to find more meaningful work. ""I really thought it was an injustice. ... Healthy food is a basic human right,"" she said. ""I decided to rip up my whole backyard and make it all a garden, and it just kind of snowballed from there."" Today, Emmons has 200 volunteers helping her tend 9 acres of crops on three sites. Since 2008, she says, her nonprofit, Sow Much Good, has grown more than 26,000 pounds of fresh produce for underserved communities in Charlotte. At first, Emmons donated her locally grown, chemical-free fruits and vegetables to churches and food pantries. But she soon started selling them herself in the neighborhoods that need them the most, for what she estimates is about half the price of organic produce sold in stores. With her 1,000-kilowatt smile and boundless energy, some might call Emmons a goodwill ambassador for healthy eating. She'd claim that her produce -- from cucumbers and okra to watermelon and blueberries -- can sell itself, but her enthusiasm certainly doesn't hurt. ""Everyone's been excited about the string beans,"" she says to one customer. ""How are you going make yours?"" She strives to make her food as affordable as possible. People are also able to use their food stamps to purchase anything she sells, including seeds and seedlings so they can grow the food themselves. Emmons and her volunteers distribute recipe cards, too, and urge customers to attend the group's free cooking demonstrations and canning classes. It's all part of their mission to help people take control over what they are eating and improve their health. And customers seem hungry for all that Emmons and her group are offering. ""We've been really, really thrilled about the response from the community,"" Emmons said. ""Even as early as January of this year, they were calling, asking, 'When are you coming back out?' "" Brandy Bolin says she was a junk-food junkie for much of her life, until she was diagnosed with diabetes six months ago. She immediately vowed to make eating healthy a priority for herself and her 11-year-old daughter. But because she is unemployed, waiting for her disability to come through, it hasn't always been easy. ""We try to eat the best we can, but we often have to cut corners,"" said Bolin, 38. ""Sometimes, that means picking the $1.49 mac and cheese over $5 worth of vegetables."" Since Bolin discovered Emmons' produce stand this summer, she has visited nearly every time it's been open. ""I couldn't believe all the beautiful, fresh vegetables, and the price that she was charging was phenomenal,"" Bolin said. ""It's making me and my family healthier."" Keeping this enterprise going is a labor of love for Emmons, who spent years doing it for free before recently taking a small salary. But she said the work has reconnected her to ideals and interests she's had her entire life. Emmons didn't have a lot of money growing up in Boston, but her parents often drove 30 miles to make sure the family had fruits and vegetables. That commitment to healthy eating carried over to adulthood, when she started gardening in Charlotte. ""There was lots of trial and error,"" she said. ""But I was fascinated with the miracle of watching seed drop into the ground and see it flower and grow fruit. It was satisfying."" Emmons also has become a certified beekeeper, so local honey is now available at her stand. And her new CSA initiative -- Community Supported Agriculture -- delivers boxes of fresh produce to families every week. She has attracted local support for her nonprofit, including a local farmer who taught her to drive a tractor and lets her grow food on his land. In August, she opened a permanent farm stand on land donated by North Carolina-based corporation Martin Marietta, and she plans to open an educational center there where she can hold classes and events that promote a healthy lifestyle. Eventually, Emmons would love to expand her organization across the country, combating food deserts wherever they exist. For now, she's devoted to helping Charlotte residents. ""When I see people coming to the farm stand ... I feel encouraged,"" she said. ""I feel like I am giving them a gift -- a healthier, longer, better, more delicious life."" Want to get involved?

From the ground, the views could not be more picturesque, the epitome of England’s ‘green and pleasant lands’. But the idyllic landscape conceals an horrific past - a terrible massacre that took place in Iron Age Britain. Excavations in Somerset – at a vast ancient site near Yeovil - have unearthed evidence of a mass murder which could have involved thousands of people. Excavated remains of the heads and necks of three late Iron Age individuals thrown into an enclosure ditch, discovered at Britain's largest Iron Age hillfort, Ham Hill, Somerset . The excavations in Somerset have dug up evidence of a mass slaughter involving hundreds, if not thousands, of people nearly 2,000 years ago . Human fingers found in rubbish dump. Human remains from the ancient site near Yeovil have cut-marks, often in multiple rows, and at the ends of important joints . More gruesome still, some of the slaughtered bodies had all the flesh stripped from their bones (a practice known as ‘defleshing’) and were chopped up. This is suggested by the cut-marks, often in rows and at the end of major joints, found on the human remains. Dr Marcus Brittain, the Cambridge archaeologist, has headed a major excavation of Britain’s largest Iron Age hill fort, Ham Hill. ‘What’s uncharacteristic is the sheer quantity of them,’ he said. ‘It’s unusual to find this number of bodies on any archaeological site let alone from the Iron Age. ‘It could not be more different to the hill fort’s modern serenity of picnics and dog-walkers.’ Archaeologists at the site say some of the bodies were even defleshed and chopped up . A roundhouse entrance and two semi-articulated bodies in rubbish pits. Ham Hill is so vast - the size of 123 football pitches surrounded by Iron Age ramparts - that only a small part has so far been excavated . The remains are thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century AD, although the site had been occupied for thousands of years . The mutilation of the bodies suggests that they were ‘trying to separate pieces of the body’, thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century AD, according to Dr Brittain. The excavation has uncovered a tiny percentage of a site that spans the equivalent of 123 football pitches, enclosed by Iron Age ramparts. ‘If you were to walk along the ramparts on the outside of the hillfort, you’d be walking for over three miles,’ Brittain said. Most hill forts date from the first millennium BC to the Roman Conquest and excavations are rare because they are protected, ancient monuments. However, an exception was made at Ham Hill because the underlying stone is one of the most important building materials in southern England and is required for the conservation of historic buildings. Ham Hill site contains one of the most important stone materials in . southern England, used in the conservation of historic buildings in the . region . In return for the Ham Hill Stone Quarry being extended, an important archaeological investigation by the universities of Cambridge and Cardiff was funded. But the excavation has raised more questions than answers. The massacre is thought to have taken place around the start of the Roman invasion, and Roman weapons – sharp and heavy ballista bolts that would have been fired by catapult – were found among the bodies. ‘There was serious aggression on the hill,’ said Dr Brittain. One theory suggests that the Romans executed people to maintain order between indigenous tribes, but defleshing is rarely associated with them. Instead, it was a cult of violence to the dead among Iron Age Britons, who often put polished skulls in doorways. The archaeologists also excavated further into the interior of the fort, which will be open to the public for a day on Saturday September 7. There, they uncovered evidence of domestic life, including Iron Age and Roman pottery and ritualistic burials, and even arrangements of human skulls. They also found black mustard seeds which, Dr Brittain said, are normally associated with the Romans: ‘We’re finding it in abundance. It means that a new food type is being cultivated and gathered... either as a preservative or a spice.’","Remains discovered Britain’s largest Iron Age hillfort, Ham Hill, Somerset .

013d48fd79a5120474349721b049f071a10c0a4c,"(CNN) -- As Pope Benedict XVI steps down, the moral authority and future of the Roman Catholic Church depends on the next pope forcefully dealing with child sex abuse in its ranks. Benedict had the power to effect fundamental, institutional change from the top that would have protected children of future generations. Benedict failed to change the Vatican's traditional methods of handling child sex abuse by priests and so abuse of children continued, with thousands of more cases. Before his installation as pope, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was the keeper of the traditional papal secrecy around sexual abuse as the leader of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. He issued Vatican orders directing cardinals, archbishops and bishops to keep credibly accused priests in ministry, to move them to a different parish or to keep them in the priesthood because they were too young, too infirm or their removal would cause too much scandal for the church. As pope, he condemned the abuse more strongly than his predecessors, but he did nothing to really change the situation. News: How is a new pope elected? What must the next pope do to regain trust and moral authority? There are seven concrete measures the future pope can and must implement to bring about change within the clerical culture on child sexual abuse.First, disclose the names of all the clerics credibly accused and known to the Vatican worldwide along with the country, state and parish or school where the offenses were allegedly committed. More than a dozen bishops have already created such lists and made them public. Second, publicly disclose all of the documents within the Vatican's archives that pertain to reports of child sex abuse, the Vatican's response to it and the hierarchy's role in the abuse. The church must begin to make amends to survivors, and exposing the secrets and concealment contained in such documents is a critical step. Third, revise church canon law and Vatican protocols so that no secrecy surrounds child sex abuse. Secrecy is toxic, and in it, child abuse flourishes.Fourth, require each bishop and church official to report clergy accused of sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement. Opinion: Benedict a pope aware of his flaws . Fifth, retain independent and outside professionals to conduct an audit to assure compliance and reliability. An example of a case where this independent investigation worked is the Louis Freeh Report regarding Penn State and the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal. Sixth, retain independent and outside professionals, nonclerics who do not have a requirement of obedience to the pope and bishops, to conduct investigations into child sex crimes by clergy. Seventh, retain independent and outside professionals to train, educate and modernize child protection procedures and protocols in every diocese worldwide. To move forward, the Roman Catholic Church and its leader, the next pope, ultimately must handle child sexual abuse among its clergy with transparency and honesty, rather than internally and secretly. Then and only then will the church and its leader regain any moral authority and move the Roman Catholic Church forward from the 16th century to the 21st on child protection. Can any and all of these things be actually done? Of course. But if past is prologue, the Vatican will continue to operate above the law in denial, minimization and blame. News: The pope in retirement -- What to expect . I do believe though that there is hope and promise for a better future with a transformative and transparent attitude at the top, with a new pope dedicated to openness and accountability for all clerics who have participated or been complicit in these crimes. I represent thousands of survivors of childhood sexual abuse by clergy, and in two of those cases, I have named Pope Benedict XVI and the Holy See as defendants, because I truly believe that all roads lead to Rome and thus, responsibility is seated there. Until and unless there is transformational change at the top, they will continue to be faced with worldwide and mounting global crises, external pressures and the continuing fall of a moral empire. Until there is change at the top, it is business as usual. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Anderson.","Jeff Anderson: Pope Benedict XVI's departure is an opportunity for real reform of child abuse .

Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie LAC, said investigators were still committed to finding out what happened to William despite not finding any clues since he went missing on September 12 last year. This comes as it was revealed William’s sister often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?' It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard  in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast, while dressed in a Spider-Man costume. Scroll down for video . William Tyrell was last seen wearing his favourite Spiderman costume when he disappeared on September 12 . Monday marks four months to the day since he went missing from Kendall on the Mid North Coast of NSW . Supt Fehon said investigators had recanvassed the area near where William was last seen in the past weeks, including searching a 1.5km radius with specialist cadaver dogs. ‘There is no indication of where he may be,’ Supt Fehon told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We’ve still got a dedicated team in excess of 10 analysts and investigators working full-time and they’re going to explore every possible avenue. ‘The main thing is going through the many hundreds of Crime Stoppers reports which have been received from the public and evaluating them, prioritising them and then being able to determine the value of the information.’ He said William's parents were being kept up to date with the investigation through what has been an ‘extremely difficult period’. ‘They’ve had to endure a Christmas without young William,’ he said. ‘They’ve indicated to me that words cannot describe their pai. Lead investigator superintendent Paul Fehon points to the house where three-year-old William was last seen . ‘They pray and hope young William will be returned to them in 2015.’ When William Tyrell's sister walks into a room, she often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?' It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast. Police still have no leads as to his whereabouts, with extensive searches of the bushland around the property failing to uncover any clues. Kendall local Kay Dollery says William's four-year-old sister, who lives with their parents on Sydney's north shore, often asks after her brother. Ms Dollery had William's Sydney neighbours stay with her when they travelled to Kendall to help during the initial week-long search in September. 'I've been to Sydney and had dinner with one of them and they said the sister keeps coming in and saying ""Has anyone seen my little brother?""' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It just brings you to tears. Supt Fuhon has revealed the Tyrell family endured a heartbreaking Christmas . When William Tyrell's younger sister walks into a room, she often asks 'Has anyone seen my brother?' Ms Dollery said the people of Kendall remained hopeful William would be found, but were devastated to have no clues four months to the day of his disappearance. 'Going through Christmas was pretty sad - the services club had William's Christmas tree which was beautiful - but I think [the mood] is just sombre as we know there is no change which is disheartening,' she said. 'I think it comes down to the question of there's just been no sign of him and that's the baffling part of it, that there's no indication of where he is, there's no indication that he was taken he's just vanished. 'I think in real terms most people would have the opinion that someone's got him and then they just live in hope that whoever's got him is looking after him and hasn't done anything awful.' This comes after it was revealed that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation into his disappearance, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie Local Area Command, said Christmas was a difficult time for the family. Members of the Kendall Services and Citizens Club gave a collection of gifts and Spiderman merchandise to William's parents in hopes the missing three-year-old will appear soon . Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of  William Tyrell who disappeared on September 12 . Police still have no leads as to his whereabouts, with extensive searches of the bushland around the property failing to uncover any clues . 'They indicated to me that Christmas was just a quiet silent time at home, the emptiness of having a void in their house,' Supt Fehon told The Sunday Telegraph. 'That's been unopened presents, not able to share the festivities, to see a smile on young William's face to receive gifts or presents like any other normal child.' Supt Fehon said a lack of evidence to support the potential scenarios has left investigators baffled. For the first time he has also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance. His grandmother, mother and four-year-old sister were enjoying a relaxing morning on the driveway of his grandmother's property. Dressed in his favourite superhero costume, William was playing a game of hide-and-seek with his sister. He was dashing around the side of the house before reappearing with a smile and returning to his his family. When he ran around out of view at about 10.25am on September 12, his mother did not check on him until 10.30am, when she went around the corner looking for him and he was nowhere to be seen. Lead Investigator superintendant Paul Fehon said a lack of evidence to support any scenario has left investigators stumped . Locals say the people of Kendall remain hopeful William would be found, but are devastated to have no clues . Neighbours watched the family frantically scouring the area and calling out his name, before they contacted police shortly afterwards. One neighbour saw William’s distraught mother pacing the quite street after William went missing. Afterwards, his father, who had been at the shops, returned and instantly joined into the search. The family had visited Kendall before, with locals recalling seeing them the previous December. Another neighbour said the community has been rocked by William’s disappearance, with children no longer allowed to ride their bikes or visit the local store without supervision. William was last seen in the front yard of his grandmother's house at Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast . Investigators have now also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance . In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that the investigation had taken a new direction. 'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation. 'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister. Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'. Searches combed bushland surrounding the home of missing toddler William Tyrell's grandmother . Police have spoken to everyone they could locate who was in Kendall on the day little William disappeared . A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'

The leaflet, which targets pupils as young as 13, gives 'safety tips' on how to take illegal substances and was produced by Edinburgh council and the city's Drug and Alcohol Project. The booklet includes street names for drugs, the 'effects and risks' of taking them and finally 'safety tips' for those 'determined to use' drugs. Pupils are advised to 'sleep well' before and after using cocaine, avoiding mixing with alcohol, to 'wash out your nose after each session' and to 'avoid sharing rolled-up bank notes or straws'. When taking MDMA or ecstasy, children are told to 'start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing' and to 'sip water regularly' but no more than 'one pint an hour'. They are also advised to 'take regular breaks from dancing to cool down.' In the advice pack, children are given 'safety tips' on how to take cocaine, as well as its street names . The booklet tells youngsters to 'take regular breaks from dancing' when taking ecstasy . Elsewhere, they are advised to only take 'short puffs' of cannabis if inhaling and to use 'low strength tobacco and unprinted roaches if smoking'. The 'Snapfacts' book is aimed at 13 to 25-year-olds and was launched yesterday for S4 pupils, aged either 15 or 16, at James Gillespie's High School, in Edinburgh, with other schools expected to follow in the coming months. The controversial approach has been criticised by anti-drug campaigners. Graeme Pearson, MSP for the Labour Party and a former police officer, told MailOnline: 'I don't believe that such publications are helpful. 'The minds of young people are inexperienced and this sort of thing will only help to confirm in their view that taking drugs is an OK past time. 'I would much prefer it if the authorities tried to get people away from drug abuse, as young people will use any excuse they can to justify their behaviour.' Mr Pearson, who is also Director General of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, added: 'The levels of drug abuse in Scotland and the number of drug deaths is still at a very high level and this year it was at its second highest level recorded. 'It would be better to give young people a future and a hope of employment than giving this sort of advice, which is misplaced.' The controversial booklet has been slammed by critics who say it will make youngsters think drugs are OK . When taking ecstasy, children are told to 'start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing' Agnes Morrison of the Maxie Richards Foundation, an anti-drugs charity said: 'I don't know why anybody would put out a leaflet telling teenagers the safe way of taking drugs. 'There is no safe way to take drugs. Drugs destroy people so why would you want to put together a leaflet? 'I've never come across anything like this. I know they are putting them in schools and that there is other educational information in there. 'But a lot of kids who do not know anything about drugs might read it and get the impression that there is a safe way to take drugs. 'It's like saying ""here are 10 easy ways to take drugs"". The only safe guidance against drugs is not to take them at all.' Cameron Rose, Edinburgh Conservative leader, said he understood there was a need to issue advice on drug abuse, but questioned the distribution of the leaflet to all youngsters. He said: 'I do understand the need to give important advice to people who are vulnerable to illegal behaviour, but for something to be distributed to all young people is perhaps not the right way. 'There are a lot of complicated issues there, but it raises questions about legitimising inappropriate behaviour. 'It seems inappropriate to be highlighting unwise behaviour.' But Gael Cochrane, a development officer for the Edinburgh Drug and Alcohol Project which is leading the project, said it was the best way to keep teenagers safe. She said: 'Some young people will look things up on the internet but many will not. Without all the facts they are in a more dangerous situation. 'We completely accept there are going to be young people who don't take drugs or drinks or have sex, and we would support them in that. 'But they are a small group, as are the ones who are taking lots of drugs. It's the majority who are undecided.'","Edinburgh council and city's Drug and Alcohol Project issued booklet .

013f6c2e1ebe8e511ac07d1096fec5b096aef439,"(CNN) -- Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California, Swiss police said Sunday. Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris, France, in June 2009. Polanski, 76, was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday, Zurich police said. A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport. He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Pianist"" in 2003. The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl. But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced, and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978.  Watch what happens now for Polanski » . Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown,"" and for best writing for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which he also directed. He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a Polanski tribute this year, when he was arrested by Swiss authorities, the festival said. A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles, California, after authorities learned Polanski was going to be in Switzerland, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, told CNN on Sunday. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put ""in provisional detention."" But whether he can be extradited to the United States ""can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised,"" a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail. ""It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision,"" the spokesman wrote. ""Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice."" Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland, but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski's sentencing process, depending on what happens in Zurich. Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was. According to a probation report contained in the filing, Huston described the victim as ""sullen."" ""She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25. She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing,"" Huston said. She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in the report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" Polanski's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out, but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request. In doing so, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski's case was handled years ago. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" said Espinoza. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely. Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare. Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case."" Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly, she said, because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Following Espinoza's ruling earlier this year, Geimer's lawyer, Larry Silver, said he was disappointed and that Espinoza ""did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption."" He argued in court that had ""Mr. Polanski been treated fairly"" his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime. Polanski's arrest Saturday came two days after one of his wife's killers died. The director's pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, and four others were butchered by members of the Manson ""family"" in August 1969. Polanski was filming in Europe at the time. By her own admission, Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Brooke Bowman, Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","In 1977 director Roman Polanski pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl .

014136b976abf7cab02d2441611ec915960ca466,"(CNN) -- The wait is finally over. On Saturday night, ""Whovians"" (""Doctor Who"" fans) finally got their first full look at Peter Capaldi in his role as the Twelfth Doctor (with no karaoke or mimes in sight). He almost literally landed with a splash, as we first saw him and companion Clara being swallowed by a dinosaur who ended up in 19th century London. Because, obviously. Here are five of our favorite moments of what was a spectacular season premiere. 1. The new Doctor himself . The Doctor was still in a bit of post-regenerative hysteria, which led to some hilarious lines. He also, of course, took a few shots at his new look, especially the eyebrows (""These are attack eyebrows! You can take bottle tops off with these!"") and the fact that he's now Scottish. That was probably one of the biggest surprises: For a Doctor who is darker than the ones we're used to recently (he certainly doesn't have the wackiness of Matt Smith), there was a great deal of humor in the episode. When we saw his final costume toward the end of the episode, we've gotta say, the Twelfth Doctor is looking sharp. 2. Clara back how we remember her . When Clara first officially met the Doctor, she was in Victorian dress. Having ended up in the 19th century, she was dressed for the times once more. Whether it was a callback or not, the producers seemed to know that the look really suits Jenna Coleman (In fact, a lot of the memorable parts of this episode seemed to do with the clothes - see Madame Vastra and Jenny's battle gear as well). With a few episodes under her belt, Clara is the ""veteran"" of the show, and much of it revolved around her, especially with the Doctor being in a confused state for much of it. She had some trouble getting used to this new Doctor, having fallen for the last one (see below), but she had instant chemistry with the Twelfth. 3. The icky new villain . A restaurant where you're on the menu? The half-visaged android the Doctor met could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money. Their face-off (sorry) toward the end was one of the most memorable confrontations in recent ""Doctor Who"" history as well. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames?! Not much to say here, except that tyrannosaurus rex was quite a way to kick off the season. 5. The Eleventh Doctor makes a call . The biggest surprise of them all was the Eleventh Doctor's time-shifted call to Clara at the end of the episode, asking her to take care of the new him. (Though he wasn't a big fan of looking old.) We'll miss you, Matt Smith! What were your favorite parts of the episode?","Peter Capaldi officially begins his run as the 12th Doctor on Saturday's 'Doctor Who' premiere .

It's notoriously difficult to get students excited about science but one teacher has found a winning formula - taking them to McDonalds. Caroline Molyneux has students flocking to her revision classes at weekends with her cunning combination of biology and fast food. Working from Sharples High School, Bolton, Greater Manchester, she said students can munch on ice creams, breakfast or lunch while they work through past papers. Caroline Molyneux (left) pictured during a study session with her students at McDonald's. She has been nominated for a prestigious national teaching award for her willingness to go the extra mile . 'We stage revision sessions in school and we started this one a month ago. It has been really successful. It is quite relaxed and informal and the pupils stay for quite a bit.' she said. 'Some have their breakfast or their lunch, and there are ice-creams on hand as we look through past papers.' And her somewhat unorthodox commitment to helping students study their biology GCSE papers has seen her shortlisted for an award. Her dedication to inspiring the next generation has her shortlisted for the prestigious 2014 School Biology Teacher of the Year Award - just one of three nominated nationwide. The science teacher is very popular with the students at Sharples High School, Bolton, Greater Manchester (pictured) for her commitment to helping them with their studies . The kids are lovin' the revision sessions at McDonald's, where they can grab a bite to eat while studying biology . The award recognises the 'very best and most inspiring biology teachers'. 'I was put forward for the award at my old school - Balshaw in Leyland,' she said. 'They kept it from me until I was shortlisted. I’m just one of three people - it was a big surprise. 'The assessors visited Sharples High School and spoke to the pupils - it is always nice to be nominated but it’s fantastic that this is because of student nominations.' The assistant headteacher has been . teaching for nine years, but has a background as a researcher at the . University of Molecular Microbiology. She now teaches biology, chemistry and astronomy and is an educational leader for the National Space Agency. She is also not scared to lay down a challenge: 'If anyone tells me they don’t like science, I will find out why. Here we make science exciting and interesting. 'Balshaw is an outstanding school and Sharples is on its way to being outstanding. I wanted to be part of that. 'I think teaching is a vocation, and not just a job. I love it and to support the children in helping them get the most out of their five years in school.' Dr Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology, said: 'Excellent teachers have a profound positive effect on their students’ learning, career choices and aspirations. 'It is rewarding to know that once again, the entrants for this award are teaching outstanding and innovative lessons which inspire their students.'","Students can grab a bite to eat at the 'relaxed and informal' study sessions .

01442297824e24a4bc69af5079593f17f1f491ba,"FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke has claimed UEFA and most of the confederations want December 23 as the date for the Qatar 2022 World Cup final - but that no decision has been made and no compensation will be paid. A FIFA task force on Tuesday recommended that the 2022 tournament should be played in late November to late December to avoid the heat of the summer. The Premier League and Football Association say a final that close to Christmas will cause havoc with the traditional festive club programme and will campaign for an earlier final date ahead of the decision by FIFA's executive committee on March 20. FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke said a December 23 final for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is supported by UEFA and the majority of the confederations, but a decision will be made in March . Valcke also ruled out compensation for leagues who lose out with the schedule saying the already get a cut of what FIFA makes out of the World Cup . December 18 remains a strong possibility - it is Qatar's national day and also falls on a Sunday, and would be early enough for the festive club programme to take place. Valcke also confirmed that the 2022 World Cup will be four days shorter as a 'concession' to the league and clubs, 28 days instead of the usual 32, and that the African Nations Cup in 2023 will be moved to June from January. He also said no apology was necessary to the clubs despite the disruption it will cause to domestic football across the globe. He also ruled out paying compensation - European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Tuesday said the clubs would demand financial settlements for the disruption. Sepp Blatter with the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani as he celebrates his country winning the right to host the World Cup in 2022 that is set to ruin the English tradition of Christmas football . The FIFA task force members, including Richard Scudamore (circled), met on Monday in Doha . Valcke told a news conference in Doha after a Qatar 2022 organising committee board meeting: 'It's not perfect, we know that - but why are we talking about compensation? It's happening once we're not destroying football. 'Why should we apologise to the clubs? We have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries. It was 40 million (US) dollars in 2010 and 70 million in 2014. 'We are bringing all our people to enjoy the sporting and financial results of the World Cup. 'I definitely don't feel I have to apologise for the decision made yesterday to confirm that the World Cup will not be played in the summer.' He added: 'Most confederations say they want the World Cup to end on the 23rd of December.' Valcke also appeared to confirm the deal to extend the USA TV rights deal with Fox to include the 2026 World Cup had been done to avert the threat of any legal action over its 2022 deal. He said: 'We have done what we had to do in order to protect FIFA and the organisation of the World Cup.' Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore expressed disappointment at the proposed schedule for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . We are extremely disappointed with the FIFA Task Force recommendation to move the 2022 FIFA World Cup to a November and December schedule. It is clear that the views of the European leagues, along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected, have not been given serious consideration throughout this process. The prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the 2022 World Cup significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions. Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game’s great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year fixture programme that season. Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further, but first we will consult with our clubs, other stakeholders in English football, and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile. Meanwhile Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan said there was no surprise in the decision to stage a winter World Cup in Qatar but that the actual timing could be crucial. Regan told Press Association Sport: 'We have been expecting this decision for some time, but it is going to run late into December and just how close to Christmas it gets is something that needs to be thought through. 'We will look at the knock-on effects of the decision and how it will affect Scottish football - clearly there will be fixture challenges for leagues across the world.' October, November and December are the only months the 2022 World Cup can be held, according to a graphic provided by the FIFA task force . On Tuesday, FA chairman Greg Dyke told Press Association Sport: 'We will have to wait to hear the detail but we will try to protect all the traditional Christmas dates.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who was on the task force that met in Doha on Tuesday, added: 'Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game's great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and new year fixture programme that season.' When will the 2022 World Cup in Qatar run? The exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘late November to late December’ 2022 has been recommended by FIFA’s task force, with Saturday November 26 to Friday December 23 mooted as a possible 28-day slot. A final decision is expected on March 20. A World Cup final near to Christmas sounds crazy... It would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time. There is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier, perhaps on Sunday December 18, which is also Qatar National Day. What’s the problem with having an earlier final? Whenever it’s played, domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare. Typically this run-up period is a month. It will need to be a minimum of two weeks. A World Cup ending on December 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early November. Any earlier and football might have to stop as early as October. What happens to the 2022-23 Premier League season? Two months of club football will be ‘displaced’, and if the period cleared for the World Cup is as mooted, that will essentially be November and December. That would mean 10 Premier League games and three Champions League games being played earlier or later. So, for example, the Premier League season may have to start a month earlier (mid-July 2022) and finish a month later (mid-June 2023). The seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this. There will be disruption, to about 50 leagues, for about three years. What about the Football League? Club football across England would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the World Cup as FIFA insist on a ‘blackout’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece. How will the fixture congestion affect domestic action? FA Cup replays could be one victim for at least a season. Premier League clubs might play fewer League Cup games. Some European competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled. The Africa Cup of Nations due for January 2023 may have to be shelved. Will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket? Almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday-season bonanza of capacity crowds, but also untold millions if TV companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons. Arguably hardest hit will be smaller Football League clubs, reliant on turnstile cash, who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks. What do Sky and BT Sport think? Both broadcasters declined to comment. But by 2022-23, we will be two more Premier League TV deals down the line after the £5billion extravaganza just agreed. Who knows who will have UK live rights then? Maybe beIN Sports… based in Qatar! You’re not serious? That’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in December 2010 that Qatar would host 2022. Rule out nothing, no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous. Is there any chance this ALL won’t even happen? Very little. And when FIFA announce a world-record sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways later this year, as insiders expect, none at all.

01462daeb1d2b20447926ffd47368bdf0116db4a,"A onetime California school official was sentenced Monday to 10 years in state prison for sexually assaulting two women when they were her students, including a woman who confronted her in a recorded phone call that went viral on YouTube. Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts. Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years . Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said . Old photo: Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 . Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister. In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said. 'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' Cardosa later resigned. Confession: The then  28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school . Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused . She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school . Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing. 'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.' Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement.

01481086a0345380b54bc7e2ba6acb72d61b3a67,"(CNN) -- ""The Darkness II"" is a gore-filled, blood-enraged slaughterfest that really wants to be a feel-good, love story. Oh, and you get to fight with characters who have four arms. Set a couple of years after the conclusion of the original game in this series, players control Jackie Estacado, a crime boss who is also host to an ancient evil known as The Darkness. This force imbues Jackie with superhuman powers including two extra arms -- called ""demon arms"" in the game -- that look like snakes with piranhas for heads. It's scary stuff. And these extra arms are essential for in-game combat. Jackie has been keeping The Darkness bottled up inside, but there are others who want the power for themselves. As the game starts out, The Darkness gets released and helps Jackie in his war against the Brotherhood. At its core, ""The Darkness II"" is a first-person shooter that adds in the demon arms and provides four different opportunities of attack. The shooting aspect is solid, with plenty of different weapons to choose from, and allows Jackie the ability to carry around two sets of weapons, at least sometimes. When you're carrying four weapons with four arms, that's when the action and that's where it really gets bloody. The two arms, which resemble snakes with piranha heads, can lash out at opponents, grab and destroy doors and fences, and help gather Essence -- the element that helps Jackie increase his powers. The arms also have some pretty bloody (and cool) finishing moves that raise the gore to med-school-dissection-class levels. Opponents get various extremities ripped off and tossed aside or violently torn in two using the legs as a wishbone. The more gruesome the kill, the more Essence can be collected. And the stronger Jackie can become by spending Essence on improved weapons, special demon arm kill bonuses or super powers. Using four arms to fight enemies works fairly naturally, but does get a little hectic in some of the group battles. In trying to gain as much Essence as possible, I found myself rushing toward distance opponents to grapple with the demon arms, but taking a bunch of damage along the way. Eventually, I decided just to pick off far-away bad guys with weapons and wait for the grunts to come rushing to me. In the game, there is no mini-map or radar to let you know where the villains are located and there will be times you just have to get hit to find out there was someone behind you. Enemies do spawn from every direction -- even places you just cleared out -- so be prepared to swivel around a lot. The artwork in the game is very graphic-noir, with a hand-painted look. It looks great. Gritty exteriors, colorful interiors and a hell-scape that was foreboding helps immerse the player in whatever environment they were in. Each area was distinct with the appropriate overall emotional landscape. Darklings are back from the first title. Or, I should say, a Darkling is back. These physical manifestations of the Darkness in your brain were used as weapons in the previous game. This time, there is only one and he acts more like a sidekick than a destroyer. Looking like an agile goblin, the Darkling provides some good comedic moments, but he's also handy in distracting opponents, getting into tight places, and short-circuiting electrical boxes when needed. There is also a point in the game where Jackie takes over the Darkling and you get to directly control it. The new viewpoint makes for a nice change of pace. For all these game-play nuances, however, the story of ""The Darkness II"" is where the game developers really wanted to make their mark. Jackie, still mourning over the murder of his girlfriend, has visions of her in the early part of the game. Players discover an eternal love between the two that eventually crosses over the barriers between life and death. That type of romantic story plays out mostly in cut scenes and cinematics. This love stuff felt jarring and out of place at times when compared to the brutality of the battles. Do you get invested in the story? Sure. However, there are a few disjointed moments that left me scratching my head and wondering what it all meant. Also, the game seemed short. Compressed action and lengthy cut scenes did nothing to make the adventure last, and the ending came around too quickly. So I was a little disappointed when I realized the story was coming to a close. Overall, ""The Darkness II"" is a solid shooter that gets amplified by the fact that you get to fight with four arms. Using the demon arms to rip opponents to shreds or fling them into the sky never seems to get old. Oh, and much like today's movies, stick around after the credits. You'll really want to see this. ""The Darkness II"" is available in North America on February 7 and in Europe on February 10. It can be played on Windows PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is rated (unsurprisingly) M for Mature due to blood and gore, drug references, intense violence, strong language, and strong sexual content. This review was done with the Limited Edition version for the PS3.","Players control Jackie Estacado, a crime boss .

The talented Silva, who played for Cruzeiro, has agreed a contract until June 2020 for a reported fee of £11.5million and will be presented at the Bernabeu on Monday. Real won the chase to bring in the creative 21-year-old, who is able to dictate play from the middle of the pitch and will be a useful under-study to Toni Kroos this season as he gains first team experience. Real Madrid new boy Lucas Silva (left) takes on Fluminense's Wagner for former club Cruzeiro . 'I have been talking with Lucas and he is very happy as one of his dreams has come true. (Real Madrid coach Carlo) Ancelotti has got a real diamond,' Oliveira, who manages Cruzeiro, told Spanish newspaper As. 'He is a technical player with good vision, he can make precise 30-40 metre passes and has a strong shot. 'I have been behind him when he has shot from outside the area and believe me he has a lot of potential that can be further exploited. He will push those who are already in his position. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti snapped Silva up for a fee believed to be £11.5million .

Cash-strapped France could sell thousands of artworks to pay off its vast national debt, a parliamentary report has suggested. The radical plan to flog paintings and sculptures from the nation's prized collections was mooted by MPs studying ways help clear France's £150billion deficit. It comes after state-run news channel France 24 last year even suggested selling the Mona Lisa - the world's most famous painting which hangs in the Louvre museum in Paris. Now lawmakers have consulted Guillaume Cerutti, the head of Sotheby's auctioneers in France, for his opinion on the sale of publicly-owned art. He said France should move closer to a model used in the United States, where museums sometimes sell unseen parts of their collections to free up resources for the purchase of more relevant artworks. Cerutti told the BFM news channel: 'Action is needed to tackle the grotesque waste in national collections. In the Louvre alone, some 250,000 works are currently hidden away in overflow rooms. 'Museums should also be given the option of selling works that have been in public collections for at least 50 years.' It would not be the first time France has sold off treasures to prop up its finances. In 2013 the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris announced it was selling 1,000 bottles of fine wine to fund renovations. Last summer, France also said it was selling a luxury state-owned apartment on New York's 5th Avenue for around £40million. In December, the government faced accusations of treason when it announced plans to sell half of Toulouse's airport, the country's fourth largest and home of aircraft maker Airbus, to a Chinese-led consortium. The government has repeatedly rejected demands to sell Leonardo da Vinci's painting the Mona Lisa, which is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60m in 1962 for insurance purposes.

The parents of a five-year-old Calgary boy who went missing with his grandparents more than a week ago insisted during a Thursday night vigil that there will be a positive outcome. Nathan O’Brien and grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes were reported missing June 30 by Rod and Jennifer O'Brien - they have not been heard from since, but the parents will not give up hope. 'We’re very hopeful that they’re out there. There’s no doubt in our mind,' Jennifer O'Brien said between tears, according to the National Post. Keeping hope: Rod O'Brien, and Jennifer O'Brien attend a candlelight vigil for Nathan O'Brien, 5, and his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes in Calgary, Alberta, Canada,  Thursday, July 10 . 'We’ve just got to find them and the police are doing everything they can do,' she continued. 'I’m hopeful in every way and we all are. I hope this turns out to be a happy story and I think it’s going to.' About 500 people gathered for the vigil, according to the paper, They wore green ribbons, held candles and fought back tears during prayers and a moment of silence. 'I like to think of this whole thing as just a way to keep the flame going,' Jeff Liknes, Kathryn and Alvin’s son, told the assembled mass. 'I don’t want to think of this like a funeral because I know it’s not one. I’d love to see them again.' The gathering came only days after police raided the suburban Alberfa farm of 54-year-old Douglas Garland and took him into custody for questioning. He is believed to have been driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared - the one found by cops in his driveway when they arrived at his farm. Police are said to be looking into a . dispute over a business deal several years ago between Garland - who is . related to the missing trio through a sister's comnon-law marriage - and . Mr Alvin, according to the National Post. Officers focused their hunt for the missing family members at three Airdrie locations on Monday. One centered around a slough and a field near the home of Mr Garland's parents, Archie and Doreen Garland. Garland once operated a drugs lab at the property which police searched over the weekend, court records showed.

Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a struggle in the their Arkhill home . After being questioned by police Garland was released the following day. He . was then remanded in custody for two days for possessing the . identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car . crash in 1980. He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment. Garland . made a brief appearance in court on Monday, via closed circuit . television, and was remanded in custody for an additional 48 hours, in . which time police could continue to interview him. Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product. Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years. He . was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the . dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges.

He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed. Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won. His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009. Monday's search involved forensics investigators and fire personnel who scoured a waterway in a rapid deployment craft. Green . ribbons have now appeared around the close-knit Airdire community, a . symbol of hope that the trio will return home safe and sound. On . Friday Calgary police Staff Sgt. Doug Andrus spoke about the . significance of locating the truck seen near Liknes family home on the . night they disappeared. Police swarmed on the Garland family farm after neighbours reported seeing the Ford F-150 there . He . said: 'We just believe given the area the vehicle was in, and the fact . that it was the night of the incident and that it drove in the area . several times, that there's a good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have information.'

A teaching assistant has escaped jail after sending lewd texts and naked photos of herself to a 14-year-old pupil. Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to the male student at a school where she worked in Telford, Shropshire, a court heard. She also sent him a series of naked photos - including an image of herself using a sex toy. Spared jail: Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to a teenage pupil, Shrewsbury Crown Court (pictured) heard. She has been handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years . The mother of two admitted one charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Shrewsbury Crown Court on Friday. However, she has now been spared jail after a judge handed her a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years. Trinder began sending Facebook messages to children at the school in 2011, before singling out the teenage boy, the court heard. Contact: Trinder sent the student lewd texts every day, saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him (file picture) She then gave the pupil her Blackberry pin number and sent him a topless photo of herself - with only her arms covering her breasts. She later messaged the boy a nude image of the lower half of her body, before sending him a photo of herself using a sex toy. Trinder also sent the student lewd texts every day - saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him, the court heard. Raj Punia, prosecuting, said the school had spoken to Trinder about her behaviour in July 2011 after discovering she was chatting to pupils on Facebook. 'She was warned she would be putting her job at risk if she continued,' she said. 'In November it was brought to the attention of the authorities that there were inappropriate activities going on. 'She gave him (teenage boy) the pin number for her Blackberry phone so he could text her for free. 'He . sent her a message saying ""hi"" and instead of ignoring the message or . telling him it was inappropriate to text her, she encouraged this . contact. 'One night in August 2011 she sent him a message saying she was out drinking and said she was ""horny"".' Sentencing Trinder, Judge Robin Onions described her as 'totally unsuited' to a career in teaching. 'The school appears to have acted completely properly and warned her and she just ignored the warnings,' he said. Dismissed: Telford and Wrekin Council (pictured), which employed Trinder, said she was fired in March 2012 . 'He was a remarkably vulnerable pupil and she was clearly sexually attracted to him. 'In many ways this is a classic grooming case, but they did meet and didnâ€™t have sexual contact. 'If there had been any contact, she would have gone into custody and it would have been measured in years. 'This young lady is remarkably immature and totally unsuited to a career in teaching. If she does anything like this again it will be prison.' Trinder has been banned from working with children for life and placed under a sexual offences prevention order for seven years. She has also been handed a two-year supervision order with 10-year notification requirements and a three-month curfew. Speaking after the case, Nigel Newman, a spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council which employed Trinder, said the teaching assistant was fired in March last year. He said: 'The individual was suspended from her employment with the council as a support assistant in February 2012 as soon as we were made aware of the allegation arising from the incident which led to her being charged by police. 'Following this, disciplinary proceedings were held which resulted in her dismissal from her job with the council in March 2013.'","Shelley Trinder sent lewd texts to student at school in Telford, Shropshire .

014c08b37cc7977e1407d363550d6de612eeb265,"(CNN) -- Manchester United have warned French side Le Havre they will take action against them unless they stop repeating claims that the English Premier League champions offered financial inducements to Paul Pogba's family in order to lure the teenager to Old Trafford. Manchester United have vehemently denied any wrong-doing in the signing of Paul Pogba (left). United have grown angry at the sustained assault by Le Havre, which came in the wake of a transfer ban imposed on Chelsea last week for a similar infringement of the rules. Now club officials have written to the French club, and made them aware in the strongest terms that they must either put up, or shut up. ""In response to the wholly unfounded comments widely reported in the media of Le Havre President, Jean-Pierre Louvel, Manchester United wish to categorically confirm that as a matter of club policy and in accordance with the applicable football regulations, we do not offer inducements to the parents of players who sign for the club such as monetary payments or the purchase of houses,"" said United in a statement on their official Web site. ""Manchester United have today written to Le Havre to put it on notice that action will be taken if such allegations are repeated in relation to the transfer of Paul Pogba."" Le Havre had claimed the matter was being referred to FIFA for their investigation although, as yet, the world governing body have not acknowledged receipt. When the Pogba issue was first raised last week, United officials suggested that there was no contract for the 16-year-old to break, therefore the Red Devils could not be offering inducements to do so. However, they have been annoyed by Le Havre's allegations of impropriety, which has prompted the stinging outburst. ""Manchester United are entirely satisfied that the transfer of Paul Pogba has been conducted in accordance with the regulations set down by the world governing body, FIFA,"" the statement added. ""Manchester United are ready to defend any claim brought against them by Le Havre to FIFA. ""It is to be noted that all contractual documentation relating to the player's registration with the club have already been fully ratified by the Football Association and the Premier League.""","English champions Manchester United issue warning to French side Le Havre .

014c40bffc4990556c2ca34665cda2c270da49d7,"(CNN) -- Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff. Nichols, 83, who directed ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and ""The Graduate,"" was the husband of former ""ABC World News"" anchor Diane Sawyer. Nichols' influence looms large in entertainment. He was among the founders of the Compass Players, the predecessor to the Chicago-based comedy troupe Second City, which has been a proving ground for comic talent for more than four decades. Share your memories of Mike Nichols . As a performer with Elaine May in the late '50s and early '60s, he took comedy into places it had seldom gone before, bringing an improvisational swagger and intellectual edge to a field that had been dominated by joke-telling standups. ""Nichols and May combined the political and social satire of (Mort) Sahl and (Lenny) Bruce with the inspired comic skits of (Sid) Caesar and (Imogene) Coca,"" wrote Sam Kashner in a 2013 Vanity Fair profile. Nichols was also an outstanding theater director. At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, ""Barefoot in the Park"" and ""The Odd Couple"" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's ""The Real Thing"" (1984), ""Monty Python's Spamalot"" (2005) and a 2012 revival of ""Death of a Salesman"" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. But he's probably best known for his movies, including the groundbreaking ""The Graduate"" (1967), the Oscar-nominated ""Silkwood"" (1983) and box-office smash ""The Birdcage"" (1996). He was known as an ""actor's director,"" one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others didn't. Dustin Hoffman remembered Nichols' ability at an American Film Institute tribute. Hoffman observed that Benjamin Braddock, the character he played in ""The Graduate,"" was a tall, blond, WASP-y type in the novel. (Indeed, among the actors considered for the role was Robert Redford.) But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic, qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen. ""And so I thank you for casting this short, 29-year-old, unknown actor with a prominent nose to play Benjamin Braddock,"" Hoffman said. ""God bless you, sir. You're more than a great director. You're a real artist down to your toes, because you're insanely courageous."" Starting with two phrases . Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931. With war clouds looming and Nazi persecution of Jews rising, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. As recounted in the book ""Faces of America,"" a young Nichols arrived in the United States knowing only two phrases: ""I don't speak English"" and ""Please, don't kiss me."" The family changed its last name to Nichols after settling in New York City, where the family patriarch established a medical practice. Nichols attended college in Chicago and later headed back to New York, where he studied acting under famed teacher Lee Strasberg. He returned to Chicago, where he started up a comedy troupe and met Elaine May. The pair would go on to form a partnership that would later take Broadway by storm. Nichols said he took to the stage. ""I liked doing the stand-up,"" Nichols told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012. ""I only stopped because Elaine wanted to stop. I've never understood it. I thought: 'Why? It's not a very long show. It doesn't cost us anything emotionally.' "" He moved behind the scenes and directed Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley in ""Barefoot in the Park,"" which won him his first Tony in 1964. For a time he was Broadway's golden boy, with success following success: ""Luv"" (1964), ""The Odd Couple"" (1965), ""The Apple Tree"" (1966, featuring a young Alan Alda), ""Plaza Suite"" (1968) and ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue"" (1971). ""Barefoot,"" ""Odd Couple,"" ""Plaza Suite"" and ""Second Avenue"" were all written by Neil Simon. He was also the director of the musical ""Annie"" (1977), which was one of Broadway's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later. Notable movies . More acclaim would follow for his work on the big screen. His first film was a biggie: ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (1966), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and won five, including a best actress trophy for Taylor. His next film, however, was in many ways even more impressive: ""The Graduate,"" which made innovative use of pop music (thanks to Simon and Garfunkel's songs), featured a terrific script by Buck Henry and Calder Willlingham and became a blockbuster sign of the New Hollywood -- one led by youthful moviegoers and antihero protagonists. ""Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the (Directors Guild) playbook for 'The Graduate,' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses, lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness, a sheen of visual inventiveness that hasn't dimmed over the years,"" wrote Slant magazine's Budd Wilkins in a 2012 look back. Nichols won best director for his work. His movies never quite caught lightning in a bottle again -- few movies do -- but still contained stirring scenes and fine performances: the launch of the planes in ""Catch-22"" (1970), the sour Jack Nicholson in ""Carnal Knowledge"" (1971), the lives of blue-collar nuclear plant workers in ""Silkwood"" (1983), the unrestrained glee of the plotting Melanie Griffith in ""Working Girl"" (1988). He also directed the TV production of ""Angels in America"" (2003), which won a then record-setting 11 Emmys. His last film as director was 2007's ""Charlie Wilson's War."" ""No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike,"" James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff. ""He had recently been immersed in a new project for HBO to adapt 'Master Class,' Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning play about opera legend Maria Callas. The project reunited him with Meryl Streep, one of his most frequent collaborators."" Nichols occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the EGOT -- an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. In 2012 he earned his record sixth Tony for best direction of a play for ""Death of a Salesmen."" He met Sawyer later in life (he was 54 at the time) and she became his fourth wife. He told The Hollywood Reporter that he first spotted the then-""60 Minutes"" correspondent on a flight and later struck up a conversation with her. ""I found her and said, 'You're my hero.' And she said: 'No, you're my hero. Do you ever have lunch?' She wanted to interview me for '60 Minutes.' I pretended that I was up for it, and we had about 14 lunches."" The couple was married for 26 years. In addition to Sawyer, Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy, Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren.

Superbowl Sunday is thought to be the day of America's second-highest day for food consumption each year after Thanksgiving, according to Reuters. The Atlanta-based Calorie Control Council said that the estimated 2,400 calories set to be consumed by the average American amounts to a slice of pizza, four cans of beer, one serving of BBQ wings, one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries. The National Chicken Council says that the country will eat 1.25billion chicken wings, with ranch, barbeque and blue cheese dressings the most popular dips. The ten-figure number of wings is enough to put more than 500 on every seat of every NFL football stadium and adds up to nearly two chickens killed for every American. Domnio's and Pizza Hut generally expect to sell around 11million and 2million slices respectively, according to Forbes. Americans will wash it all down by drinking 325.5million gallons of beer.

014cfb5391b7eeec17b3254dfa61ac5bf637fcdd,"By . Martin Robinson . Business success: Nicky Blair, the football agent son of Tony Blair, is understood to have secured a record fee for a Mexican star this summer . He has some way to go before  he matches his father’s multi- million-pound fortune. But Nicky Blair certainly seems to be heading in the right direction. After setting himself up as a football agent, Tony Blair’s middle son has reportedly struck his first big deal – collecting 10 per cent from a £6.7million transfer. Nicky, 27, apparently helped negotiate the big-money move of Mexican Hector Herrera to top European side FC Porto in June. But that record transfer for a Mexican player may be dwarfed if his compatriot Marco Fabian, who is also represented by Nicky, is snapped up by Premier League or European clubs next year for a reputed £10million. Nicky was once thought to want to follow his father into politics. But unlike older brother Euan, 29, who is tipped to stand for Parliament, Nicky left Oxford, where he studied modern history, and taught at an inner-city school in the West Midlands for two years. He and his university friend Gabriel Moraes then launched themselves into the lucrative field of football agencies. Last year he was sharing a desk in his mother Cherie’s London law practice but his Magnitude agency has reportedly become so successful that it now has offices in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. Star player: FC Porto's £6.7million Mexican midfielder Hector Herrera runs with the ball last week, and moved to the European giant in a deal secured by young Blair . His success makes him a chip off the old block. Tony Blair makes millions of pounds a year advising governments and international firms, and is said to be worth £60million to £80million. He is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 hidden in a network of private firms. However he is believed to have paid for the a four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London where Nicky lives. Nicky's mother was a director of  Magnitude Limited until May, owning 20 per cent, and allows her son to use a desk at her business in central London. Supportive: Nicky, pictured left with his siblings Kathryn and Euan, has had help from his parents, including mother Cherie, who is a director of his company and on one occasion helped court a young star on his behalf . EUAN BLAIR: Euan is the eldest Blair child and is the only one with obvious political ambitions. The Labour seat of Coventry North West could become vacant as current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015, and the 29-year-old is thought to be keen. He is currently chief commercial officer for recruitment agency Sarina Russo Job Access. Last month he married his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire. KATHRYN BLAIR: 25-year-old Kathryn was called to the Bar last year by Lincoln’s Inn – the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s. The young barrister has a boyfriend and lives in £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, near his own central London property. LEO BLAIR: 13-year-old Leo is the youngest child, and known to be musically-gifted, currently appearing in the English National Opera's production of The Magic Flute . The schoolboy is playing 'Spirit', and made his West End debut in the chorus of Bizet’s Carmen last year. In 2000 he was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister for 150 years, and was named after Tony Blair's late father. Mrs Blair had even taken major steps to help Nicky secure top players in the Americas. In 2011 she took time out of her busy international schedule to meet an unknown Mexican footballer. A car collected then 17-year-old soccer prodigy Raul Mendiola from his family’s rundown trailer-park home in a Spanish-speaking suburb of Los Angeles and took him to the plush hotel where the wife of the ex-Prime Minister was staying. She spent time chatting to the footballer before posing for a photograph with him. Just days later, in an apparent attempt to cement confidence in her son’s business, Raul’s mother Claudia Velador received a picture of a smartly dressed Mr and Mrs Blair, personally signed with the words ‘Thank you’. But it emerged that Raul had no idea he had entrusted his future to a man whose parents are on first-name terms with the world’s most powerful people. Speaking from her home in San Bernardino, California, Claudia said: ‘Raul didn’t have a clue he was dealing with a former Prime Minister’s son'. He now plays for David Beckham's former side LA Galaxy. Nicky gave up being a school teacher to set up the company with Oxford University friend Gabriel Moraes. However, it emerged earlier this year that the business was loss-making and was to be dissolved and restructured.

Proceeds from the June 4 auction go to the U.S. Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture fund and will be used to compensate ""the many victims of this crime of historical proportions,"" said Neil DeSousa, U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Florida. ""Rest assured that the U.S. Marshals Service's top priority in this case was restitution toward the victims."" To date, about $24 million in property sales and $80 million in cash assets from the Madoffs have been recovered, the Marshals Service said. Art, antiques, furniture and clothing from the Madoff residences in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, were featured in the 275 lots included in the final auction. Madoff, the mastermind of an estimated $50 billion Ponzi scheme, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to 11 felony charges, including money laundering, perjury, false filings with the SEC and fraud. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison.","Auction proceeds will go toward compensating victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme .

An aristocrat is fighting her neighbour's plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London. Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, says rows over people digging 'mega-basements' beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a conservation area in Hampstead, where dozens have signed a petition against the application. She is one of 58 people to have objected to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house. Lady Listowel is one of dozens of locals objecting to a proposed basement in the smart north London street (file picture) Architects' plans submitted to Camden Council show the scale of the planned basement at Mrs Abiola's house . Lady Listowel, the widow of the 5th Earl of Listowel, William Francis Hare, said: 'It is sad that there is a row over the application as everyone usually gets on around here. 'These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.' Mrs Abiola bought the house, which is close to Hampstead Heath, three years ago.  Neighbours said the owners, whom they believed to be Nigerian, owned several properties in the UK and were not often at the house. An initial application featured plans to build a swimming pool under the house but was rejected by Camden Council in 2011.  The new plans incorporate a basement that would extend under the house and into the garden. Neighbour Oliver Froment, 63, said he was concerned his house might collapse if Mrs Abiola's basement were built, and said it had happened in several similar cases in Hampstead. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People are just trying to show off by building bigger and deeper, with no consideration for the character of the area or the people who live there.' Mrs Abiola's £3.6m house is in an expensive street in a conservation area near Hampstead Heath, pictured . Mr Froment, who works in financial services, has hired an independent expert who said he was concerned about the impact of the proposed works. Camden Council's Valerie Leach said: 'It is essential that the views of residents are taken into account and at present we have received a number of objections and reports that are being reviewed to ensure that planning officers can make a recommendation on the application.' Rows over vast basements are becoming increasingly common in London, where space is at a premium. Last month it emerged that a Labour peer was suing his neighbour for 'trespass' over his newly-dug basement, claiming that it went underneath his own property. Lord Mitchell claimed his Hampstead neighbour Daphne Gillian Singer had undertaken 'hidden' works by digging up a courtyard next to both of their homes.  He and his wife have lodged a writ at the High Court and are seeking up to £200,000 in damages after Ms Singer allegedly built walls beneath his property without consent. Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik boasts London's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool under his Kensington home . Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool. Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street.  His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park. Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house.","Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, has joined Hampstead residents in protest .

A 10.30am press briefing means 10.30am and Keane arrived on the button in the Moyne Suite in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday. Straight-backed, eagle-eye stare in place, arms folded, Keano looked like he was braced for trouble. Maybe he was. Initially, everything ran smoothly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane refuses to answer questions on hotel incident . Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane spoke to the media in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday . It only took a few minutes before the spat involving Keane and Frank Gillespie, in another part of the hotel, was pitched into the mix. Are you prepared to go into it (the incident)? ‘No, I’m not,’ said Keane firmly. Was it a distraction? ‘No,’ he said, clearly inviting another subject. In the room the FAI media folk let out a sigh of relief. Keane had kicked for touch, and found it. Tick tock. Tick tock. Perhaps lightening up, Keane gave an incisive insight into the performance on Friday, his annoyance at the concession of the goal, and what was needed from the players for the next six games if Ireland are to qualify. His appreciation of the challenge facing him and Martin O’Neill was flecked with nuggets as Keane plugged Robbie Keane’s abilities over Niall Quinn, and hailed the long-serving striker as ‘as good a professional as I have come across.’ Keane believes his namesake Robbie is a better frontman than former Ireland striker Niall Quinn . Keane also joked about being able to leave the hotel without any security baggage. ‘We’re not One Direction,’ he said with deadpan wit. He revisited his touchline spat with the referee in Celtic Park on Friday night. ‘I was surprised he came over. That’s our job to try to get instructions on to a player or to appeal a decision. I don’t think there was anything over the top,’ he said. ‘When a referee comes over and there’s a couple of photographs taken as usual it always looks 100 times worse than what it is, but it was no big thing.’ For over half-an-hour everything was calm, cordial and under control. Keane had a wee dig at Jack Grealish’s indecision about declaring for Ireland. Keane had a dig at Jack Grealish (left) over the Aston Villa youngster's indecision about declaring for Ireland . More seriously, he expressed concerns that Everton manager Roberto Martinez may be putting a squeeze on his Ireland players, specifically Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy. ‘It does seem to be that Seamus and James are under lots of pressure — they’re turning up, or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling,’ he said. And then, Sportsmail asked Keane about all the distractions involving him over the last six months, most recently the hassle with Gillespie. Tick tock. Tick tock... boom. Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty . Everton's James McCarthy has missed the Republic of Ireland's last three Euro 2016 qualifiers . Sportsmail: ‘I’d like your thoughts on this, between the Celtic link, Villa link, book being published, and the incident last week….’ Keane: ‘I’m not giving you any comment. Why would you think I have to give you an opinion on everything? Do you think you’ve a right to sit there and ask me anything you want, and get an answer? I think I’ve been more than fair with you.’ Sportsmail: ‘You have (been fair). But my point is Martin (O’Neill) has been asked about the distractions. Has he had enough of those distractions? Keane: ‘What are you asking me for? What are you talking about? What distractions? Can I do anything about the Celtic stuff?’ Sportsmail: ‘Yeah, Celtic and Villa.’ Keane: ‘Can I do anything about them things that come up? If I get approached about a job and I’m up front with the manager and the media, do you want me to… how is that a distraction? ‘What can I do about that? You’re making out I’m bringing all these distractions on.’ Keane claimed the media are making out he is bringing distractions to the Republic of Ireland squad . Sportsmail: ‘Just a coincidence?’ Keane: ‘Well, if a club approaches me, these things just happen, yeah. You think the book’s a distraction to a group of professional people? Do me a favour. ‘And then people all writing about the incident the other night, lies….and people have got pals and talking to them. ‘You think I’ve got to justify that to everyone? You all sit there and think I’ve got to answer to everything? Who in the hell do you think you are? I’ve got to answer to you? ‘I answer to the FAI and Martin. And if we don’t get the right results, I’ll be gone and you won’t lose a minute’s sleep, so don’t worry about distractions. The things you write about are distractions.’ Sportsmail: ‘We write about it, but it was an obvious thing to write about. There was an incident.’ Keane: ‘Exactly. But you’re on about Celtic and Aston Villa. What do you want me to do about them? If Celtic approached me, what did you want me to say? You couldn’t get enough of it. So what can I do about the Celtic situation?’ Keane was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team's match against USA on Tuesday . Sportsmail: ‘I don’t know. It was extraordinary that Martin brought it to our attention…’ Keane: ‘What other incident? The book? Do you think the book was a distraction? An agreement was made six months before it was out. Ask Martin. What’s he said?’ Sportsmail: ‘I think he’s had enough of these (distractions)?’ Keane: ‘Go and ask him. Go and see him in the lobby. You’re not brave enough to ask him?’ Sportsmail: ‘I am brave enough to ask him.’ Keane: ‘Go and ask him. You’re asking me what Martin O’Neill might be thinking? Why don’t you ask Martin? What if we qualified? Do you think it will be a distraction? Are you thinking it’s all a distraction from the result the other night?’ Keane accused the media of not being brave enough to ask  manager Martin O'Neill about the 'distractions' Sportsmail: ‘It was the build-up to the game for 24 hours. Everyone was talking about it.’ Keane: ‘What was the problem? Sportsmail: ‘We were all talking about it.’ Keane: ‘Talking about what? Talking about something you don’t have a clue about, and everyone writing lies. The usual nonsense.’ Tick tock. Tick tock.

0150b84a06d2bd0f1614ea80bcf356ed8aac46dd,"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 5 December 2013 . House prices in Britain will rise far more sharply than expected in the next five years, it was revealed today. Official figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility published as part of the Autumn Statement show the cost of buying a house has been severely underestimated. House prices will on average rise by 5.2 per cent next year, 7.2 per cent in 2015 and will be 10 per cent higher in 2018 than predicted, the OBR says. This will crush many people's hopes of owning their own home. On the up: The OBR has today changed its predictions for house price rises to 8.2%, with the cost peaking in 2015 . But George Osborne said in his Autumn Statement today than the OBR's new forecasts still left real house prices 3.1% lower than their 2007 peak. The OBR sharply increased its forecasts, with homes expected to cost 10% more by 2018 than it had previously predicted, and Mr Osborne acknowledged there was a 'weakness of supply' in the market. Message: Mr Osborne used his Autumn Statement to say that he would get house building moving but admitted there was a 'shortage of supply' Mr Osborne said: 'Some of the most important infrastructure for British families is housing and we have to confront this simple truth: if we want more people to own a home, we have to build more homes. 'And the OBR is absolutely right today to draw attention to the weakness of housing supply in this country. 'The good news is the latest survey data showed residential construction growing at its fastest rate for a decade. And our hard-won planning reforms are delivering a 35% increase in approvals for new homes. 'But we need to do more.' The Housing Revenue Account borrowing limit will be raised by £300 million for councils, which will also be encouraged to sell off their most expensive properties to fund more cost-effective homes. Mr Osborne said: 'Aspiration isn't only for people who can afford their own home. We want to regenerate some of our most run-down urban housing estates. 'Councils will sell off the most expensive social housing, so they can house many more families for the same money. 'We are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job. 'Right to Buy applications have doubled under this Government and we'll expand it more.' The OBR noted that the growth in residential investment had left household finances in deficit and the gross debt to income ratio rising. Its report said that was consistent with low interest rates and schemes such as Help to Buy but 'may pose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term'. Mr Osborne acknowledged that the market should be 'functioning' but 'stable' and the Bank of England had powers to deal with any housing bubble. Rising high: House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November alone, according to the Nationwide . He said: 'Help to aspiring families and building more homes - that's what we stand for. But we must also avoid the mistakes of the last decade. 'We want a responsible recovery. 'That is why I am the first Chancellor to give the Bank of England the responsibility and the power not only to monitor overall debt levels, but to take action to deal with asset bubbles if they threaten our stability. 'We want a functioning, stable housing market. 'The OBR's latest house price forecast, while higher, still has real house prices 3.1% lower in 2018 than at their peak in 2007.' The Goverment's coffers will receive a boost from the buoyant housing market, with revenues from capital gains and stamp taxes forecast to increase. The OBR said: 'Our forecast for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is much higher than in March. We now expect receipts to almost double over the forecast period, from £8.9 billion in 2013/14 to £16.8 billion in 2018/19.' Comparison: This graph shows how the OBR predictions were much lower in March this year compared to today . By 2017/18 higher house prices will contribute around £1.8 billion to the forecast, while a higher volume of transactions will add £1 billion to receipts. Increasing prices will mean 'a greater proportion of transactions' become subject to higher stamp duty bands, the OBR added. Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment and housing board, said the measures would 'provide a glimmer of hope' to people facing lengthy waits for a council house. 'Government has today acknowledged councils' argument that the current restrictions on our ability to invest in new housing are not fit for purpose,' he said. 'This is an important first step towards untying the hands of local authorities to build the new social housing which millions on housing waiting lists desperately need.' It was also announced that families with granny flats or converted buildings will get 50 per cent off their council tax bill. The policy will save £500 off a £2,500 bill.","Office for Budget Responsibility sharply increases its estimates today .

The foundation is part of a larger settlement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that will 'take care' of Duncan's four children and his parents, the attorney said, but did not reveal how much the settlement was worth. Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee who was quarantined at her home following his diagnosis and then struggled to find a new place to live,  will not receive anything in the settlement. Scroll down for video . Thomas Eric Duncan died on October 8 from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. The Liberian man was initially sent away from the hospital's emergency room with antibiotics which authorities admitted was a mistake . Josephus Weeks, left, nephew of Thomas Eric Duncan, and Mai Wureh, center, sister of Mr Duncan, look on as attorney Les Weisbrod speaks during a news conference in Dallas on Wednesday about the family's settlement from Texas Health . Mr Weisbrod told reporters the hospital 'wanted to do the right thing'. Details of the deal were not . released and the family will not be billed for his care, the attorney said. Hospital officials said a settlement had been reached but did not provided details. Duncan died on October 8. The Liberian man was initially sent away from the hospital's emergency room with antibiotics, something hospital administrators have acknowledged was a mistake. Texas Health has already apologized to Mr Duncan's family. Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, has previously been critical of the care Duncan received, saying his death was partly due to his race, nationality and lack of insurance. Mr Duncan's fiancée, Louise Troh, (pictured) will receive nothing from his settlement . But on Wednesday, he credited Presbyterian's officials for moving quickly to settle the case and acknowledge mistakes. Mr Weeks said he will be 'the face of the foundation', which he hopes will lead to a new hospital or the dedication of a hospital wing in Liberia. 'The main focus is that Eric's name is on something and everybody knows that he didn't die in vain,' he said. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas confirmed the creation of the foundation in a statement and said it has 'amicably addressed all matters' with Duncan's family. The hospital has apologized for releasing Duncan the first time, and after initially denying he had told them he was from West Africa, they acknowledged key caregivers missed his travel history in their record system. Duncan's sister, Mai Wureh, said that the hospital had satisfied her request for the remainder of her brother's medical records, including lab results of his treatment with the experimental drug brincidofovir. Wureh also said she and Weeks met Wednesday morning with John Mulligan, the nurse who administered the drug. 'He gave me closure because he was the last one in that room. He was able to talk to him, comfort him. He held onto him, and that made me feel better. At least he didn't die alone,' Wureh said. Mai Wureh, center, sister of Thomas Eric Duncan, smiles after she and Josephus Weeks, nephew of Duncan,  concluded a news conference in Dallas . A suit against the Dallas hospital faced long odds due to the state's regulations on malpractice suits that have made it one of the hardest places in the United States to sue over medical errors, especially those that occur in the emergency room, according to plaintiffs' lawyers and legal experts. Duncan, a Liberian national who arrived in the . United States, first sought treatment at Texas Health . Presbyterian Hospital in late September, telling staff he had . come from Liberia, one of three West African countries hit . hardest by the Ebola outbreak there. He was infected when he helped a pregnant neighbor in Monrovia seek hospital treatment . Two days after he was discharged, Duncan had to be carted . back to the same hospital by ambulance, and became the first . person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus. He . was placed in an isolation unit and died 10 days after being . admitted, with teams of medical staff tending to his care. Two nurses who treated Duncan, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, . both contracted Ebola and later recovered. The hospital apologized to Duncan's family for not being . able to save his life and said it made a mistake by initially . discharging him. The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,900 people so far . this year, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. From her home in Monrovia, Liberia, Mr Duncan's sister made an extraordinary attack on U.S. doctors in an interview with MailOnline. 'He died like a dog': Mary Pearson, 52, sister of Thomas Eric Duncan, who became the first U.S. victim of Ebola. She believes he was allowed to die in revenge for bringing the virus to America . Reverend Jesse Jackson (left) stands with Nowai korkoyah (center) the mother of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, as well as his nephew, Josephus Weeks, during a press conference on the day before Mr Duncan died last month. Texas Health announced today that his family will be taken care of as part of the settlement . Grieving Mary Pearson claimed that the deadly virus was created as part of an experiment to infect black people on the continent - echoing the views of a race-hate preacher who says Ebola was invented to 'depopulate' Africa. America invented the Ebola virus to 'kill Africans' and deliberately left victim Duncan to die 'like a dog' in revenge for bringing the disease into the U.S, Mrs Pearson claimed. Mrs Pearson insisted that her brother did not receive the same level of care as American citizens who had contracted the disease and were taken back to the US for treatment. Of the nine people who have been treated for Ebola in the U.S., only Duncan has died and his nephew Josephus Weeks said: 'We begged. We pleaded. I even offered my own blood, even though it wouldn't do anything for him. We requested everything we could think of to save Eric. They said no.' Mrs Pearson said: 'Eric suffered in exile and it really hurts me.They didn't feel sorry for him. They didn't give him drugs. They had the means to treat him but they treated him like a dog.

The tiny Himalayan nation has been trying since 2008 to draft a constitution. When it failed to reach any kind of agreement last year, Nepal dissolved its parliament -- paving the way for Tuesday's vote. The 601-seat constituent assembly will double as the parliament. The army has been called in to help police provide security after an alliance of 33 parties vowed to disrupt polling. Despite fears, officials and reports say that voters turned up in large numbers in the 18,438 polling centers across the country to choose assembly members. About 12 million people are eligible to vote. ""Except in a few places, elections are being held peacefully,"" police spokesman Ganesh K. C. said. In the capital Kathmandu, an 8-year-old boy was injured Tuesday morning when an object he found on the street that he thought was a toy exploded, police said. Earlier reports said that three people had been injured. In Dang district, about 350 kilometres (217 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, three people were arrested with explosives-making materials, K.C. said. The anti-poll alliance called a country-wide transport strike in the runup to the elections. But people largely ignored the call and are voting ""enthusiastically,"" said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai. About two dozen people were injured in several incidents over the last week when petrol bombs were thrown at passenger buses. One person later died of injuries in hospital, police said. No party is expected to win a majority although the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Nepali Congress will vie to be the largest party. For most of its history, Nepal was a monarchy. The Maoists carried out a 10-year insurgency to abolish that system. The fighting claimed about 15,000 lives before the Maoists signed on to a peace accord in 2006. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time. But since then, lawmakers have not been able to come up with a constitution for the country's 27 million people. Preliminary results will be available Thursday. But final results will take at least a couple of weeks.","Nepal has been trying to draft a constitution for five years .

It has also emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside. Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, have arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least $2 million in the hope of recovering the $180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs.

Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family . The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Telegraph. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared.

The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data.

The High Street ‘Knicker Queen’ she was supposed to transform M&S’s lingerie from frumpy mummy-pants into sexy, sleek, and elegant bestsellers. However Janie Schaffer didn't have time to perform the underwear magic she had previously worked for super brand Victoria's Secret as she resigned a mere 3 months into her post as director of lingerie and beauty for the firm in a move that has shocked the fashion world. The 51-year-old designer is now suing Marks and Spencer for an undisclosed figure, said to be ‘well in excess’ in £1 million. The 'knicker queen' Janie Schaffer has worked at some of the  top lingerie brands in the world . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley modelling Marks and Spencer's underwear: Janie believed she would have full artistic control over the lingerie . Ms Schaffer is seeking damages for Victoria's Secret shares she claims she lost out on because M&S were so keen for to start at the soonest possible opportunity. She is also suing for the remainder of her years’ salary, having started the role in January 2013 and quit in April. Shaffer was hired by M&S shortly before the company revealed its pre-tax profits had slumped by £31.5 million the previous year. At the time the company boasted of her ‘stellar retail pedigree’ and saying she ‘completed’ the re-vamped clothing team. And chief executive Marc Bolland’s excitement and confidence seemed well founded. Janie headed up brand Knickerbox in the Eighties and Nineties, before moving to Victoria’s Secret where for five years she created sexually but classy underwear. She and Stephen Schaffer founded Knickerbox together in 1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work ethic made Knickerbox an explosive  success . Janie is suing Marks and Spencer's for shares she claims she lost out on by leaving Victoria's Secret, where she worked for 5 years . With a touch of Parisian chic, Janie seemed the master of combining sex appeal with style, and helped launch the Victoria’s secret brand into the stratosphere. The rift with M&S came over an apparent misunderstanding of her role within the company, with Janie believing she would have total creative control over all aspects of the company’s lingerie. A spokesperson for M&S told The Financial Times ‘This matter is in the hands of our lawyers and we have absolutely no further comment to make.’ Born Janie Godber, she started her career at Marks & Spencer as a buyer, aged just 22. Close-knit: Janie Schaffer, centre, with ex-husband Stephen Schaffer and their triplet daughters (l-r) Amber, Madison and Daisy . There she fell for South African-born Stephen Schaffer, a handsome young merchandiser with an infectious entrepreneurial bent. They founded Knickerbox together in . 1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work . ethic made Knickerbox an explosive success. Before . launching the business in October 1986 with a single shop on Regent . Street in London, Stephen and Janie had spent six months honing their . business plan, inspired by chains such as Sock  Shop and Tie Rack, which . were at the time  incredibly successful. Immediately, they grabbed attention, . not least in June 1987 when they publicly presented Mrs Thatcher with a . pair of electric blue knickers. By the time they married in 1988, Knickerbox was making annual profits of £6 million. The couple had triplet daughters  by . IVF and, by 29, Janie was the Nineties poster girl for . businesswomen-mothers, with 120 stores across Britain and the Far East . in her empire and raising her girls without the help of a live-in nanny. So . devoted was she to the business  that in June 1993, just three months . after giving birth by caesarean, she returned to work – though she left . at 5.30pm three days a week, determined to be part of family life. Schaffer is happy to stay out of the spotlight these days. After . living a seemingly charmed life making fashion headlines throughout the . Eighties and Nineties, in 2005, at the age of 44, she embarked on a . passionate relationship with Princess Diana’s biographer Andrew Morton . while still married to her Knickerbox co-founder husband, Stephen. The . relationship lasted only months and, soon afterwards, she emigrated to . New York where she has lived discreetly ever since. And in 2006, the . couple once known as the Bonnie and Clyde of the bra world divorced . after 18 years of marriage.

Kou Thao, 28, of Wausau, pleaded no contest in September to second-degree intentional homicide in the April 2013 death of 58-year-old , of St. Paul, Minnesota. Thao was sentenced in Marathon County Circuit Court, also receiving 20 years of extended supervision after his release. Kou Thao (above) sentenced to 40 years in prison in the fatal shooting and dismemberment of a Minnesota man . Thao, who was also convicted of hiding a corpse and possession of a firearm by a felon, was accused of shooting and dismembering Hang, and taking Hang's severed head to Milwaukee in the trunk of his car in the spring of 2013. Other body parts were found in the basement of a Milwaukee home. A motive in the killing was unclear with prosecutors saying it appeared the two men met just days before the shooting. A Marathon County judge ruled last year that Thao was mentally capable of assisting with his own defense. Thao's attorney, Steven Kohn, had argued his client deserved less than the maximum sentence of 80 years in the prison system, including time in prison and on supervision. 'I don't think this is a young man who is a worst-case offender and for whom we have no hope,' Kohn said Wednesday. But Marathon County Deputy District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon told Judge Michael Moran that Thao had a ""pattern of criminal behavior and violence"" as far back as 2002. Hang's son, Shoua Neng Hang, said that his father was a loving man who was devoted to his family and took his children fishing and camping. 'Losing and saying goodbye to my father is one of the most difficult things I have gone through,'  Hang said. 'If tears could build a stairway to heaven, I would walk right up there and bring my dad home again.' When it was Thao's turn to speak, he said the killing was not premeditated or intentional, but that it happened in the heat of the moment. He also apologized to the victim's family and his own, according to the newspaper. 'I am not a monster,' Thao said. 'I am truly sorry.' Before sentencing Thao, the judge said that the crime had shocked the community. 'It's more like an execution than an accident,' Moran said.","Kou Thao, 28, of Wausau, Wisconsin was sentenced to 40 years in prison and 20 years of probation for a 2013 murder .

In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video . New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room  on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints . The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday.  Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007 . Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake . Rumors that a new player might be added . to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions . were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black . female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times . that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the . first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels . also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was . initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He . saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their . performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for . the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels . says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of . the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them . into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show . for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady . Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do . with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no . sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.","LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones auditioned for a cast member position last month and were hired as writers instead .

01554ebb431ce8ba20ff4ded5e6db196990364a0,"A crippling strike by Air France pilots continues despite company bosses offering to withdraw controversial plans to expand the low-cost Transavia brand in Europe. With the costly strike now in its 11th day, Air France-KLM has called on pilots to return to work 'immediately' in exchange for its offer as it attempts to bring an end to a labour dispute that has grounded around half of the airline’s fleet. But the pilots, who walked off the job to protest the expansion plans, have remained defiant and are making further demands. Grounded: Air France says it has cancelled hundreds of flights since the pilots' strike began . In a statement issued Thursday morning, SNPL, the main pilots' union, said the strike is being ‘maintained’ for the time being, although negotiations were scheduled to resume in the afternoon after they broke off overnight. The union said it had made further demands regarding workers' terms of employment under the no-frills Transavia brand within France, but that management had refused these. The striking pilots have said they also want Air France pay and conditions to be extended to Transavia France pilots. On strike: Air France pilots continued their job action even though the airline has offered to scrap the expansion . Air France has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights since the pilots began their strike on 15 September at a cost of £16 million a day. SNPL is accusing the airline of trying to move jobs to countries with lower taxes and cheaper labour, and they fear the expansion would erode their pay and conditions. Air France-KLM had planned to develop Transavia with hubs in France, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe to compete with budget airlines. It previously offered to delay the expansion until December in a bid to convince the pilots to return to work. But the pilots threatened to extend the strike ‘indefinitely’, prompting the latest offer from airline bosses. Big loss: The airline says it is losing up to £16m a day while the pilots protest Transavia's proposed expansion . Facing mounting political pressure to make concessions, Air France-KLM said it proposed the immediate withdrawal of Transavia Europe, insisting there would be no outsourcing. The statement said: ‘This proposition addresses the concerns of the social partners and brings a new guarantee that there will be no delocalisation (of jobs).’ Signed by Air France-KLM chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and Air France chief executive Frederic Gagey, the statement said there is ‘no longer any reason to strike.’ Meanwhile, Vereinigung Cockpit, the union representing Lufthansa pilots, has warned that they could also go on strike as talks over early retirement scheme stalled again Thursday. The union has already held four strikes this year and a fifth could deliver more misery for European travellers.","Pilots went on strike on 15 September over proposed Transavia expansion .

There was just one problem - she needed to lose 5st to fit into the A-line dress. Kirsty  weighed 15st 4lb and was a size 16 when she spotted the dress but discovered it was only made in a size 8. Scroll down for video . Kirsty, pictured before her weight loss, says she has also gained weight easily . Kirsty pictured in her dream size eight wedding dress on her special day in May this year . Determined Kirsty bought the dress anyway - and amazingly managed to lose all the weight ahead of her big day. Kirsty, 25, said: 'When I saw the dress, I just knew that I had to have it. 'The fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive I needed to really transform my life and get back into shape. 'I wanted a wedding album that I could be proud of and I knew the only way I was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress.' Kirsty, from Maesteg, Bridgend, said: 'I had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what I ate. A chronic snacker, on a bad day Kirsty would eat whole pack of Jaffa Cakes . Kirsty was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling . 'I am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert. 'I noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self-esteem. 'I put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son. You are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two, but that is a complete myth. 'You only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally. 'I put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and I didn't lose it after my son was born.' She was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. Her doctor said the falls were because of her weight. Kirsty's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic . Switching to a healthier low-fat diet, cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off . The final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Kirsty said: 'I remember walking down the beach and being approached by a group of women who were all in great shape and looked amazing in their bikinis. 'I felt so self-conscious because I was so badly out of shape and could see they were looking at me. I knew I had to change.' Mother-of-two Kirsty had bought the dress last August and when she finally tied the knot in May this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb. She had lost a staggering 76lb, or 5st 4lb, - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted. Kirsty achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly. She had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite Jaffa Cakes - on a bad day, she could munch her way through a whole packet. Kirsty was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small . Her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal. Kirsty switched to a healthier low-fat diet, cut out the snacking and started eating low-calorie bread. She also started taking Forza Supplements Raspberry K2 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more. And if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet, she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it. Kirsty said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape. She said: 'Once I put my mind to it, I found it quite straightforward. Kirsty says her wedding day was the 'happiest' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards . 'The Forza Raspberry K2 capsules were a big help. I started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more.' At the end of her weight loss journey Kirsty was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress. 'It meant so much to me,' she said. 'The dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when I had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago. 'My wedding day was the happiest of my life and I loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 'I had the wedding album I had always dreamed of.'","A chronic snacker, on a bad day Kirsty would eat whole pack of Jaffa Cakes .

0159e6fc2c528a7d8137ade6299cd35400043be6,"James Haskell celebrated his return to the England fold with a typical all-action display in their 21-16 win over Wales, but he ended up red-faced after running into the post instead of diving over for a certain try. The Wasps skipper has been in and out of the England side for years now, but with injuries piling up in the back row he was given the nod and certainly put his hand up to become a mainstay with a powerful performance at the Millennium Stadium. But England were 16-15 down and putting Wales under intense pressure when Haskell ran straight into the post in a slapstick moment amid the fury of battle in the RBS 6 Nations opener. James Haskell (centre) was denied a try during England's 21-16 victory over Wales on Friday night . Haskell (with the blue scrum cap) is tackled by Wales' Toby Faletau into the post protector in Cardiff . Haskell (blue scrum cap) bounced back off the post protector at the Millennium Stadium on Friday . 'I knew I wasn't going to get there so I tried to hit and bounce back out and I bounced back into the post unbelievably, but only I could do that,' he told BBC Sport. In the end it did not matter as fly-half George Ford booted England clear with two late penalties and that was a remarkable turnaround after Wales raced into a 10-0 lead after eight minutes. With the Cardiff crowd still dazzled by a fireworks and lights show beforehand, Warren Gatland's men caught England cold as Rhys Webb scampered over and Leigh Halfpenny added the extras and a penalty. But England built on some mighty work by their forwards as Bath backs and Six Nations debutants Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph both claimed touchdowns. Ford added three penalties and a conversion - his second strike after Wales wing Alex Cuthbert had been sin-binned - while Wales failed to score in the second period after another Halfpenny penalty and a Dan Biggar drop-goal had given them what appeared to be a solid advantage. Faletau (right) pushes Haskell into the post as he is prevented from scoring a try for England . Haskell (centre) is tackled by Wales' Alex Cuthbert (left) as he advances with the ball for England . Haskell said afterwards that Stuart Lancaster's men always believed they were capable of turning things round, adding: 'We've done a lot of work, there's a lot of talent in this group, and I think we felt if we stick in the game, keep our discipline and play in the right areas then we were going to get tries.' Ford once again showcased his talents, remaining cool under pressure to boot over the decisive penalty after England had given themselves an 18-16 lead, and he was just glad to give his side their just rewards for a stellar evening's work. 'I just wanted to knock it over for the lads really. The performance they put in, especially the pack again, was outstanding so it was the least I could do to kick that,' he said. 'We felt comfortable first half. We obviously had a bit of a poor start but to come out and score 13 points, the message at half-time was exactly the same as the messages before the game.' Faletau (obscured) tackles Haskell during England's famous victory at the Millennium Stadium . Wales boss Gatland paid tribute to England's second-half show, despite clear frustrations over his side throwing away the 16-8 advantage they held at half-time. 'Give England credit, I thought they played particularly well in the second half,' he said. 'I thought we started the game well and played pretty well in the first half, were reasonably comfortable at half-time, but we weren't able to score points in the second half and that sometimes happens at top-level sport.' There was a question mark afterwards over George North being allowed to play the whole game, despite picking up several heavy knocks, and some were questioning if he was showing signs of concussion. Gatland belayed those fears and backed his medical team, adding: 'Well that's part of the medical protocol. The medical team wouldn't have let him back on the field unless they felt 100 per cent confident that he was okay, so you've got to back your medical team and I haven't spoken to them about it. George seems fine.' Haskell (second right) celebrates with England team-mate Billy Vunipola (left) at the final whistle .","England beat Wales 21-16 at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night .

015a8c6844420202dafaf8aa88e51f83c2747ab0,"England is the only developed country producing school leavers who are worse at maths and reading than their grandparents, according to a damning report. The study found 16 to 24-year-olds are among the least literate and numerate in the world, lagging behind those in countries including Estonia, Poland and the Slovak Republic. England came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Damning report: An international study has found that the UK's young people are 'among the least literate and numerate in the developed world' (file picture) The figures showed many Japanese school leavers are more advanced than English university graduates. The OECD said England was the only country where the oldest age group  studied (55-65) had a higher proficiency in  literacy and numeracy than the youngest (16-24) after other factors such as sex, socio-economic background and type of occupation were taken into account. The organisation warned England would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken. The Tories said the report exposed the failings of Labour during its 13 years in power. ‘These are Labour’s children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations,’ said skills and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock. Labour came to power in 1997 after Tony Blair pledged his priority would be ‘education, education, education’. England was the only country in developed world in which those aged 55-65 performed better than 16-24-year-olds . Today's . findings show that the billions poured into education by Labour failed . to push up standards of literacy and numeracy, critics have said. The . Government has claimed that the OECD's research underlines who . 'Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a . diet of dumbing down and low expectations.' Official . figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown that . Labour’s spending on education rose from £35.3billion in 2000 to . £63.9billion in 2009. Yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations. Last year a different report found despite Tony Blair declaring his priorities as ‘education, education, . education’ when he swept to power in 1997, a huge increase in spending . on schools led to ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’. The OECD study – Education at a Glance – found that expenditure on . UK primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of GDP . increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009, higher than . the OECD average of four per cent. At the same time, there has been ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report said . Spending in the sector soared by 78 . per cent from £50billion to £89billion by the time the party lost the . election in 2010. During this period, GCSE and A-level grades rose every . year, which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down. Andreas . Schleicher, of the OECD, said young adults had more qualifications than . those nearing retirement, but not greater abilities. This indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills. The finding ‘doesn’t look good for the UK’, Mr Schleicher said. The 466-page study was the first carried out by the OECD into the work skills of 16  to 65-year-olds, establishing their abilities in literacy, numeracy and problem solving. A total of 166,000 were interviewed in 24 countries, including 9,000 in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales were not covered. The study found a quarter of adults in England (8.5million) have the maths skills of a ten-year-old, with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers. Literacy levels are also below average, with 16.4 per cent of adults (5.8million) reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school. Just 42.4 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving. This was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 50.7 per cent, and 21 behind the best-performing country, South Korea. Not moving forward: This chart from the report shows how Britain's young people and older people are roughly at the same level, whereas countries like Korea are showing huge improvement between generations . Picture of Britain: This graph shows how the UK compared to other industrial nations when it came to numeracy . Interesting: Countries like Japan, Netherlands and Sweden were the top performing in terms of literacy, even though children start school often years later than British youngsters . England produced 8 per cent of the world’s most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s. This has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue. The report said the ‘talent pool of highly skilled adults in England... is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries’ in the next few decades. The slide could be reversed only if ‘significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people’. England also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood. One positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent, resulting in high productivity and wages. The Coalition has taken steps to improve education, demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher. The number of top GCSE and A-level grades has now decreased for the past two years. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The OECD report highlights what our members tell us – that young people don’t have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly. We need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age.’ The shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, defended Labour’s record, saying it ‘drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010’. Failed? The Government said today this generation of young people are 'Labour's children' 'force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations' Mike Harris, of the Institute of Directors, said the report ‘underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers’ real-world experience of interviewing and employing people’. Former Labour education and employment secretary David Blunkett questioned the OECD’s methodology and said the report ‘warranted united action, not party political point scoring’. Education has undergone massive change since Labour began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965. In 1988 GCSEs replaced O-levels and the National Curriculum was introduced, and in 1997 Labour abolished the Assisted Places Scheme awarding free places at fee-paying schools to gifted children from low or middle-income families. The academy schools programme began in 2000, with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control. In 2010 the Coalition launched free schools, which are similar to academies  but can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, charities. Participants in the skills survey were asked to answer a series of questions testing their numeracy, literacy and problem solving. Here are some examples: . NUMERACY .

015afc4660fd3b64909815d2dafaba679e834675,"Diepsloot, South Africa (CNN) -- In a country where several rapes are said to occur every minute, in a township where violence is commonplace, this was a crime that shocked the entire community of Diepsloot, South Africa. Two girl cousins, aged two and three, were taken from their doorstep -- kidnapped in broad daylight. And when Yonelisa and Zandile Mali were found a few days later in the township north of Johannesburg, the news only got worse. The two girls had been raped and murdered, their lifeless bodies dumped in a public toilet in Diepsloot. Pistorius case brings South Africa gun culture to global spotlight . Since that discovery October 15, five men have been accused of kidnapping, raping and killing the two little girls. The suspects appeared briefly in court in Pretoria Thursday but the trial has been adjourned until November 1 while investigations continue, Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, told CNN. Investigators are currently analyzing DNA evidence and awaiting official identification of the five men, he said. A confession from one of the suspects was legally obtained and will be used in court, according to Simasiku, but the other suspects have not confessed to the alleged crimes. All five will defend themselves in court. Residents of Diepsloot demonstrated outside Pretoria Magistrate's Court as the men made their appearance, voicing their anger over the killings. The sprawling, densely populated township on the outskirts of Johannesburg is one of the most violent places in the country, making it a challenge for any parent to keep their child safe here. But Yonelisa's mother, Thokozani Mali, tried her best. She was at home with the girls on the day they were taken, checking on them every five minutes as they played together. Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . She discovered they'd vanished after going to check when all went quiet. Family, neighbors and the police joined a frantic hunt for the toddlers. Ten days after their bodies were found, Thokozani finds it hard to talk about the loss of her only child. ""I am trying to be strong,"" she told CNN. ""When I am sleeping, she always next to me, so when I think of that I feel like crying."" A box of the girls' shoes is outside her home, waiting to be given away to those in need. But for the moment, the pain is still too raw. 'Gruesome incidents' South African President Jacob Zuma last week condemned the girls' murder, as well as the apparent torture and abuse of a young boy whose body was found in a field in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg. ""These gruesome incidents of extreme torture and murder of our children do not belong to the society that we are continuously striving to build together,"" he said in a statement. ""Whilst we appeal to the communities not to take the matters into their hands, we also want to urge them to work with law enforcement authorities to find the perpetrators and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law."" Arrests for rape are rare in South Africa, and only 6% of rape cases lead to convictions. But rape itself is far from uncommon. South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world, with an average of 55,000 reported cases a year. The true figure is likely much higher, though, since many victims stay silent, according to Prof. Rachel Jewkes of the South African Medical Research Council. Surveys of adult women in South Africa's Gauteng province, which encompasses Johannesburg, Diepsloot and Pretoria, suggest that 25 women are raped for each one who reports it to the police, she said. ""If you take into account that rape is so under-reported, there are several rapes every minute in this country by our estimate,"" she said. While some 60% of the women raped in South Africa are adults, about 15% are children under the age of 11, she said. ""We do see rapes of children of age 3 and 2 every year but obviously not that many,"" Jewkes said. She has seen a disturbing increase in cases where those attacked are both raped and killed. About a quarter of girl children who are murdered are raped, Jewkes said. The police station in Diepsloot has one of the highest rates of reported rapes in the country, she said. She believes that to change this, authorities will need to tackle the root causes -- poverty, lack of policing, and the problem of men's attitude of sexual entitlement toward women. CNN's Arwa Damon and Brent Swails reported in Diepsloot and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Botched robbery: Eric Rivera Jr, pictured on Friday, was convicted of second degree murder today in the slaying of Red Skins star Sean Taylor . Convicted: Rivera sat quietly at the defense table with his lawyers after the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or emotion . He sat quietly at the defense table . with his lawyers after the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or . emotion. The courtroom was packed with Taylor and Rivera family . members, but there were no outbursts. Neither prosecutors, Taylor's family nor the family of the football player's girlfriend would comment after the hearing. In the confession, Rivera said the group . of five young men, all from the Fort Myers area, had driven to Taylor's . house planning to steal large amounts of cash he kept inside. Victim: Washington Redskins football player Sean Taylor is shown at training camp in Ashburn, Virginia . They . thought Taylor, 24, would be out of town at a game against Tampa Bay, . but didn't realize until it was too late that he was home with a knee . injury. Taylor's then-girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, and their . 18-month-old daughter, were also home at the time. They were not hurt. Four other men were also charged in the . case and three will be tried later. Venjah Hunte, 25, pleaded guilty to . second-degree murder and burglary charges in a deal that calls for a . 29-year prison sentence. Testifying in his own defense, Rivera . claimed it was Hunte who brought the 9mm handgun and who shot Taylor. Rivera insisted that he was not told about the burglary plot until the . group was driving across Alligator Alley toward Miami, and that he . stayed in the car outside Taylor's house the whole time. The murder weapon was never found. Police say it was stuffed in a sock and thrown into the Everglades. Taylor, a Pro Bowl safety who had . starred at the University of Miami, was shot in the upper thigh, . damaging his femoral artery and causing massive blood loss. Admission: Suspect Eric Rivera pictured in court today. Since Rivera was 17 at the time of the killing, the maximum sentence for his crime is life in prison and not the death penalty . Witnesses . say Taylor was shot when he confronted the group with a machete outside . his bedroom. A medical examiner said he was essentially dead on arrival . at a hospital on November 26, 2007, although doctors did manage to restart . his heart for a while. Aside from Rivera's confession, police . found shoe prints outside Taylor's home that matched sneakers some in . the group were wearing that night. Witnesses testified Rivera was seen . driving a rented black Toyota Highlander believed used in the crime, and . another witness said the group of five had burglary tools when they . came to her house after Taylor was shot. An American hero: One prosecutor described Taylor as an American hero who was innocently sleeping with his girlfriend and their baby when he was killed . Taylor, a first-round Redskins draft . pick in 2004, signed an $18 million contract with the team and was . becoming one of the NFL's top defensive players when he was slain. Several witnesses, including Garcia Haley, testified that he liked to . keep large amounts of cash around his Miami house. One of the men charged in the slaying, . 25-year-old Jason Mitchell, attended a birthday party a few weeks . earlier at the house for Taylor's half-sister, Sasha Johnson — who lived . in Fort Myers and knew Rivera. She testified that Taylor gave her a . purse containing $10,000 in cash at the party, which was witnessed by . all the guests. That event put the wheels in motion for . the burglary plot, witnesses said. Rivera himself testified that some in . the group thought they would get between $100,000 and $200,000 to split . up. Also charged and awaiting trial are Mitchell, Charles Wardlow, 24, and 22-year-old Timothy Brown. Jackie .

My parents don't really want me to leave but they understand my decision. I just don't want to put them at risk. 'It really has unnerved me. You don't know what some people are capable of. 'I have reported it to the police and they have told me they will investigate. I am meeting them again and will take it from there.' In August, Mr Barton was left with a bruised lip after he was punched in the face in a nightclub in Romford, Essex. During the altercation, the suspect allegedly shouted: 'You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you' in reference to Mr Barton's £5,000 taxpayer-funded nose job. The wannabe celebrity claims to be good friends with White Dee from Benefits Street, set on James Turner Street in Birmingham . Mr Barton, pictured with fashion stylist Gok Wan, has reported the online threats to the police . Mr Barton said he was driven to sue the NHS for the 'botched' nose job because it has left his nose 'uneven' He has also spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. He payed £5,400 for another nose straightening operation which was not done by the NHS. Mr Barton said he had been driven to sue the health service because of negative comments people have made since he hit the headlines after his 'uneven' nose job. Despite the backlash, Mr Barton - who claims to be best friends with Benefits Street's White Dee - still intends to continue his quest to become the 'perfect man'. He added: 'I don't really feel good about myself. I still want loads of surgery done.' A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Mr Barton has been in to the police station to report online death threats. 'We have arranged for him to come and see an officer so he can give us the full facts and we can take it from there.'","Sam Barton flees home after getting death threats on Facebook and Twitter .

The boys – cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11 - spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after the terrifying accident, which police said could have killed them. Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday.

The Director of National Intelligence responded Saturday to the disclosure of classified government surveillance programs, saying these measures kept Americans safe and are 'authorized by Congress'. Hoping to 'dispel some of the myths' after leaked documents published by The Guardian and The Washington Post shed light on two top-secret government surveillance programs, James R Clapper said in a statement the purpose of the programs is 'to obtain foreign intelligence information, including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies'. This week, The Guardian published a classified document that detailed how a division of Verizon was ordered to give cell phone records to the NSA. The Guardian and The Washington Post also reported that another program, called 'PRISM', was used by U.S. intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. In statements, those companies denied providing the government with special access to their files. Defensive: Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper said in a statement Saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were 'reckless' Both the phone-records program and . PRISM were approved by a judge, but PRISM allowed government agencies to . gain access to various Internet conversations, including email. In his statement, Clapper said PRISM, which was authorized in the Patriot Act, has been in place since 2008. The Associated Press reported Saturday that earlier this week the NSA filed a criminal report with the Justice Department in relation to the leaks. Clapper called the disclosures 'reckless'. 'In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context–including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government–to these effective tools,' he said. 'In particular, the surveillance activities published in The Guardian and The Washington Post are lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress.' Clapper's statement came as a new Guardian report revealed more information on the NSA's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal the government uses a data mining tool, called Boundless Informant, to map information the agency collects. The Guardian reported the agency collected 'almost 3 billion pieces of intelligence from US computer networks over a 30-day period ending in March 2013'. 'The tool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collections against that country,' according to an NSA fact sheet about the program obtained by The Guardian. In his statement, Clapper said the agency is limited in discussing their intelligence gathering practices by the NSA's need to protect their methods and sources. Informant: The Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper, left, released a statement on PRISM, which is reported to have been used to gather information from the data centers of Internet companies like Facebook, one of which is pictured left . 'Necessary': The top intelligence official, James R Clapper, said the NSA's intelligence measures disclosed in recent reports were 'used to keep Americans safe' 'Disclosing information about the specific methods the government uses to collect communications can obviously give our enemies a ""playbook"" of how to avoid detection,' Clapper said. Clapper added the recent disclosures have caused 'significant misimpressions', adding he could not correct all 'inaccuracies' without revealing even more classified information. In order to 'dispel some of the myths', the NSA also released a three-page fact sheet on intelligence collection as outlined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The fact sheet noted the government 'does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers' but only through court approval with provider's knowledge. Congress also authorized the use of PRISM, which the fact sheet called an 'internal government computer system' and 'not an undisclosed collection or data mining program'. The fact sheet also tried to dispel many Americans' concerns, noting the government cannot target anyone's computer or phone records without 'an appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition (such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities, or nuclearproliferation) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. National security: Top intelligence official James R Clapper said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are 'necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies' The fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government. 'Finally, the notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches,' the fact sheet said. In the fact sheet, Clapper also highlighted how intelligence gathered using these programs has provided 'insight into terrorist networks and plans'. 'For example, the intelligence community acquired information on a terrorist organization's strategic planning efforts,' he said in the fact sheet. 'Communications collected under Section 702 have yielded intelligence regarding proliferation networks and have directly and significantly contributed to successful operations to impede the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies.' President Barack Obama also noted the importance of the intelligence programs in an event in California Friday. 'I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,' he said according to multiple reports. 'My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly–we actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going have to make some choices as a society.'","Surveillance programs have 'proven vital to keeping the nation and our allies safe' said Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper .

015dbd8619fc328a1a43148ffa72f615884c59cf,"(CNN) -- Roger Federer secured a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title to dash the hopes of Andy Murray and a partisan Centre Court crowd. Federer made it 17 grand slam titles to his name after a two-and-a-half-year drought and matched the haul of American Pete Sampras at the All England Club. The Swiss will return to the top of the world rankings as a result of his 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 victory, meaning he will match his hero Sampras' record of 286 weeks at No. 1. For Murray, the first Briton to reach a men's singles final at Wimbledon in 74 years, it represented his fourth defeat in major finals, and his pain was acutely felt by a fervent crowd at Wimbledon. Sampras: I hated (and loved) Wimbledon . Federer's triumph was his first at Wimbledon since 2009, with his last major win coming at the Australian Open in 2010 when he also beat Murray. ""It's amazing,"" Federer told the host broadcaster. ""It equals me with Pete Sampras, who is my hero, so it feels amazing. ""I think I played some of my best tennis in the last couple of matches. It's worked out so many times here that I play my best in semis and the final. I couldn't be more happy -- it feels being great being back here as the winner. It's a great moment."" Federer's victory means he is only the second player in the men's game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30, alongside Andre Agassi. ""As we know, the world No. 1, you don't get that gifted,"" he added. ""I was up two sets to love in the quarters last year, two sets to love up at the U.S. Open ... so many chances, maybe I got nervous, maybe the other guys were just too good. ""I never stopped believing and I started playing more even though I have a family and it all worked out, I got great momentum and confidence and it all came together. It's a magical moment for me. ""I've obviously gone through some struggles as well, a lot of changes have happened in my life since so this one comes at the right time, as any grand slam victory."" Murray had started well, spurred on by a fervent home crowd desperate to see a first British winner in the men's singles since Fred Perry in 1936, breaking Federer in the very first game. Wimbledon grass faces Olympic race against time and nature . And though the 25-year-old then lost his own serve, he summoned another break to take his first set in a grand slam final. As a tense second set neared its climax, Federer then executed two perfect drop shots to stun Murray and take it 7-5. The third set was locked at 1-1 when a heavy burst of rain arrived, forcing the players off court as the recently installed roof was closed. The change in atmosphere played into Federer's hands as he reappeared rejuvenated. An epic sixth game of the set lasted for 20 minutes and 10 deuces as Murray desperately tried to cling on to his serve. But once Federer secured the break he quickly finished the set and then broke for 3-2 in the final set, sinking to the turf as a cross court forehand from Murray handed him his seventh title. Afterwards, a tearful Murray joked: ""I'm getting closer. I'd like to congratulate Roger. I was getting asked the other day after I won my semifinal, was this my best chance because Roger is 30 now? Well, he's not bad for a 30-year-old. ""He played a great tournament. He showed what fight he still has in him. So, congratulations Roger you deserve it."" Murray saluted the fans who offered him such support throughout the tournament, and remarked on the pressure that comes with carrying a nation's hopes of finally ending a 76-year British wait for the men's title. Expectations had been raised even higher after Jonathan Marray became Britain's first men's doubles champion at Wimbledon since 1936 on Saturday. ""Everyone always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon but it's not because of the people watching,"" Murray said. ""They make it so much easier to play. The support has been incredible so thank you.""","Roger Federer wins his seventh Wimbledon title beating Andy Murray 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 .

01610c5d388d8682cf26afb121e473cbd68cc7f8,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has confounded expectations by delivering a cool, considered denial of charges leveled against him during a keenly-anticipated corruption trial that has captivated China. So far, the public has heard more details of the case than many anticipated. Live tweets from the court house in Jinan, Shandong, are now being followed by more than 460,000 people and this number is expected to rise. After the first full day of testimony, CNN asked prominent China analyst Cheng Li, from the Brookings Institution in Washington, for his thoughts on how and why the trial has veered so dramatically off-script. CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case. What has been the most surprising twist? Cheng Li: There were two surprises. One is that Bo has rejected all allegations so far, and said he ""unwillingly"" accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team. The second surprise is that the prosecution has performed very poorly in trying to make a strong case against him; it seems to be falling apart. All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most. CNN: Did Bo and his legal team wrong-foot the leadership? Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable. If you reviewed his career he always surprised people. He has always played the wildcard. It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that. When you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare. There's a lot of praise in Chinese social media for the judge for his professional manner, but the prosecutors are terrible. Bo has rejected virtually everything in a very effective way. But that means even the leadership can't rely too much on the promises or deals made by Bo. CNN: Do you think a deal was done before the trial and does that appear to be unraveling? Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges. The deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him. If you look at September 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the Communist Party -- there were about six or seven charges, including obstruction of justice and womanizing and, probably most importantly, during the investigation of the murder of Neil Heywood they allegedly found some other criminal activities. In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power. CNN: What's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption? Bo was the wrong person to focus on corruption because he was famous for being anti-corruption during his tenure in Chongqing. And relatively speaking, at least in people's perception, he's not that corrupted. He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption. Bo Xilai's real ambition is not about the money. He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader. By that time the whole country would be his. That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership. Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges. So what kind of verdict will they give him? Certainly it will not be too severe. If it's too lenient they'll receive other serious criticism so it's really a no-win situation for the leadership. CNN: What do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this ""change of script""? Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him. In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent. Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did. I think the authorities' case is not in good shape on day one. CNN: Has the leadership's tactic backfired? Could Bo have gained more support than he's lost in the past 24 hours? Li: Absolutely. There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail. But he presented himself very well. He was very respectful, reasonable, had a human touch, he cared about Dalian, he cared about its people. He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys. He made a clear cut with his wife; blamed many things on his wife, especially the things that he claimed he did not know. Also, his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations. Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways. CNN: Did you find it surprising that he seemed to turn on his wife, Gu Kailai? Li: A line has been drawn. His defense lawyer kept emphasizing her unstable mental status and most of the people in China believe that. If you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court, it looks like there's a problem. Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument. So Bo has successfully drawn a line between him and his wife and used it to undermine her testimony. CNN: There was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake-up Chinese politics. Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict? Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse. So this case already has a strong impact. In 18 months a lot has changed; there's been a leadership succession, Wen Jiabao's retirement, and the princelings have consolidated their power. The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues. That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system. CNN: Given the apparent troubled nature of the prosecution's case, is there any chance Bo could be in the 0.1% of Chinese suspects not convicted at trial? Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous. But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial. So there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days. I think certainly the sentencing won't be the death penalty, probably not even the death penalty commuted to life. The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.","China expert Cheng Li: Bo Xilai trial takes number of surprising turns .

Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor; Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician; and a Somali driver named Billan were the MSF workers who were killed. Another member of the team was slightly wounded, the group said in a posting on its Web site. ""The exact circumstances of this fatal incident are not yet clear,"" the posting said. Also killed was journalist Hassan Kafi Hared, 36. The remote-controlled mine erupted as he was walking to a news conference in Siyad Village in northern Kismayu, said the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ). He was working for the government-run Somali National News Agency and a Somali Web site called gedonet.com. He is survived by a wife and three children. ""This is a targeted attack and we declare that this brutal killing on the journalist and the aid workers is an attack on the society itself,"" said NUSOJ Secretary General Omar Faruk Osman, in a news release. ""We demand that transitional government and the authorities in Kismayu to identify the culprits of this crime and bring them to justice"" he said. The medical humanitarian organization said it was evacuating remaining international members of it staff from Kismayu. Hared is the second journalist to be killed this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The first, 38-year-old Norwegian reporter Carsten Thomassen, died Jan. 15 in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. In a written statement, a representative of U.N.

The actions come ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, where it is also expected to be confronted on issues including its executive pay packages and marketing to children. Early Wednesday, organizers changed the location of their demonstration after learning McDonald's closed the building where they had planned their actions and told employees there to work from home. The corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, has several buildings on a sprawling campus. Scroll down for video . Demands: Protesters are pressuring fast food corporations to pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour and offer better benefits . Protest: Demonstrators from across the country gathered at McDonald's corporate headquarters in Illinois on Wednesday . Riot: Riot police were dispatched to McDonald's Illinois headquarters after hundreds of protesters gathered there to demand better wages . Down the street from Hamburger University, dozens of police officers in riot gear warned protesters to disperse. People dressed in McDonald's uniforms essentially volunteered to be arrested by peacefully crossing a barricade or remaining on the property after being asked to leave. Organizers said about 100 McDonald's workers who traveled from around the country were arrested, along with community leaders and supporters. Among them was Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, who said in a statement released after her arrest that she wanted McDonald's workers to know her union members stood with them. The SEIU has been providing financial and organizational support to the fast-food protests, which began in late 2012 in New York City and have been spreading to other cities and countries. Angry: The protesters are said to be employees from several fast food restaurants, not just McDonald's . Arrests: The protesters say police arrested about 100 demonstrators who refused to leave the property . While turnout for the protests has varied, they've nevertheless struck a chord at a time when the gap between the country's rich and poor has widened. Executive pay packages are coming under greater scrutiny too, and shareholders last week rebuked Chipotle Mexican Grill's compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million for its co-CEOs in a non-binding, advisory vote. McDonald's Corp., which is far bigger than Chipotle, gave CEO Don Thompson a pay package worth $9.5 million last year. Outside its headquarters, 25-year-old McDonald's worker Jessica Davis said she wasn't worried about being arrested. 'I'm worried about not being able to pay my bills,' said Davis, who earns about $9 an hour at a Chicago restaurant. She said she supports two young children and relies on public assistance and help from her family to get by. A spokesman for the Oak Brook police department, George Peterson, said the arrested protesters were being processed and would be released, with court dates being assigned later. He estimated the crowd of demonstrators at up to 1,500. Clash: The demonstrators clashed with police on several occasions during the protests . Shareholders: The protests were held in coordination with McDonald's annul shareholders meeting . Pay gap: McDonald's CEO Don Thompson was given a pay package worth $9.5 million last year . Although some municipalities have higher rates, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and translates to about $15,000 a year for a person who works 40 hours a week. But most fast-food workers are given far less time on the clock, in part because restaurant owners want to avoid paying overtime and limit the number of employees who receive benefits, if they are offered. Protesters also plan to demonstrate outside the company's annual meeting Thursday morning. Shareholder meetings offer the public a rare chance to confront top executives at major publicly traded companies. While ordinary investors typically don't attend, the meetings are frequented by public pension funds, activist groups and religious organizations seeking to change corporate practices. Although other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Taco Bell use many of the same practices, McDonald's is a frequent target for critics because of its size and high profile. In a statement, the company said it respects 'everyone's right to peacefully protest.' Later, spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem called the protest 'very much a staged event.'","Hundreds of fast-food workers from across the country descended upon McDonald's corporate headquarters in Illinois on Wednesday .

Scientists hope to send the first humans to Mars by 2025, but as it currently stands, anyone who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation. Experts estimate that the radiation would be enough to increase an astronaut’s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent. Other risks faced during long-term spaceflights include blindness and bone loss from the microgravity environment. Astronauts who takes a roundtrip mission to the red planet would be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation, according to Nasa . Now a panel of scientists is urging Nasa to draft a clear set of ethical rules to ensure the health of astronauts on long-duration flights, according to Space.com. A report from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM) argues that guidelines on exceptions to Nasa’s current health standards are needed. ‘From its inception, space exploration has pushed the boundaries [of human endurance] and risked the lives and health of astronauts,’ Jeffrey Kahn, chair of the IOM committee, said in a statement. Experts estimate that the radiation exposure on a trip to the red planet would be enough to increase an astronaut¿s lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than three per cent . Avoid harm by preventing harm, exercising caution, and removing or mitigating harms that occur . A mission must provide benefits to society . Seek a favourable and acceptable balance of risk of harm and potential for benefit . Respect autonomy by allowing individual astronauts to make voluntary decisions regarding participation in proposed missions . Ensure fair processes and provide equality of opportunity for mission participation and crew selection . Recognise fidelity and the individual sacrifices made for the benefit of society by offering health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes. ‘Determining where those boundaries lie and when to push the limits is complex. Nasa will continue to face decisions as technologies improve, and longer and farther spaceflights become feasible.’ The report says that ethical principles should include finding a balance between risk of harm and potential benefit to the society. It adds that Nasa should offer health care and protection for astronauts during missions and over the course of their lifetimes. According to Nasa, a mission to the red planet would take several years to complete and, during which time, astronauts would face health risks from cosmic rays and energetic particles from the sun. Both types of radiation can damage DNA and increase the risk of an astronaut developing cancer. On current missions in low-Earth orbit, astronauts are protected from the most harmful effects of the radiation as a result of Earth's magnetic field. This creates a shield around the planet that deflects much of the radiation. In deep space, however, astronauts will be without this protection. ‘Astronauts put their lives and health at great risk for their country and humankind,’ said Dr Kahn. ‘Our report builds on Nasa’s work and confirms the ethical imperative to protect astronauts' health, while fulfilling the agency's mission of exploration.’ Other risks on a mission to Mars include vision impairment and bone loss from the microgravity environment .","Trip to Mars would increase astronaut's risk of developing cancer by 3% .

Animal welfare campaigners claim to have discovered dozens of stray dogs including several puppies buried alive in a mass grave in China. Around 100 animals were hurled into a 20ft-deep ditch apparently dug using heavy machinery, suggesting government officials may be behind the killings, say activists. Once inside, earth was reportedly shovelled on top of them, leaving to them to suffocate. One puppy and three adult dogs were rescued after a charity was called in to investigate. Condemned to death? Animal welfare campaigners found more than 100 stray dogs (above), including several puppies in a 20ft-deep ditch before they were allegedly buried alive by government officials in China . Horrific: Charity workers attempt to dig down into the newly filled-in pit where  around 100 stray dogs were seen a day earlier. A handful of dogs were rescued after whimpering was heard coming from under the ground . The Yinchuan Dawn Pets Home group . investigated after a woman searching for her pet dog near a garbage dump . in Alxa League, near China's border with Mongolia, where dogs are . regarded as vermin, told them that the animals were trapped last . Wednesday. Chinese internet users expressed outrage . after pictures of the dogs before the alleged burial were posted by the . charity on Sina Weibo - China's version of Twitter. When the charity visited the site the following day, they found that the pit had been filled in. Animal . rights campaigner Li Yeh, 28, said: 'We had a call from a member of the . public that there were some dogs in a hole, but when we went there the . next day it had been filled in. 'We could even hear some whimpering when we started to dig down.' One of the lucky ones: Only this tiny puppy and several adults were rescued after a charity was called in to investigate by a member of the public who stumbled across the pit . In safe hands: The only puppy to be rescued is nursed back to health after narrowly escaping suffocation . Another charity worker said: 'Even by local standards this was a barbaric and heartless act. 'When volunteers arrived the next day they saw the trench filled in but heard the plaintive cries of some dogs near the surface. A handful were rescued, severely traumatised but alive.' A charity volunteer told AFP that another visit was made on Friday, but by then it appeared that the dead dogs had been moved elsewhere in what the group said was an attempt by local officials responsible for enforcing city laws - called Chengguan in China - to hide the grim burial. 'We hired an excavator and found in the place where the dogs were buried six dead dogs which were damaged by an excavator before we got there,' the volunteer surnamed Fan told AFP. 'These dogs all had soil in their mouths and noses, which means before we arrived at the scene local Chengguan had already transferred the dogs' bodies to another secret place.' Uproar: Chinese internet users expressed outrage after pictures of the dogs before the alleged burial - and the ones rescued - were posted by the charity on Sina Weibo - China's version of Twitter . Cover-up? A charity volunteer said another visit was made the next day, but by then it appeared that the dead dogs had been moved in what the group said was an attempt by local officials to hide the grim burial . An official from the local Chengguan office denied the allegations and said an investigation had been launched. 'We are investigating if some stray dogs were buried alive,' the official told AFP. 'I can ensure you we didn't do this kind of thing, and moreover, we are not in charge of stray dogs.' Officially called the City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, the Chengguan operate in every community in China. The Chengguan have a reputation for heartless treatment of the people they monitor - often the poorest in Chinese society.

01672a244484a9089e3955d2876559260a663c74,"The jury in the murder trial of an Iowa teenager heard on Wednesday a disturbing 911 call in which the 13-year-old suspect admitted to killing his own mother after a failed attempt to rape her. Crooks, who is now 14, was charged with first-degree murder and assault with intent to commit sexual abuse in the March 24, 2012, slaying of his mother, 37-year-old Gretchen Crooks. In the 911 recording made on the night of the murder at the family's Osage home, Noah Crooks could be heard telling dispatcher Barb Michael: 'I’m not joking at all. She’s dead. I’m scared. I killed my mom with my .22. I don’t know why I did it.' Killer: Noah Crooks, left, allegedly shot his mother Gretchen, right, multiple times in her Iowa home and then called police . During the conversation, which lasted about 10 minutes, the boy repeated his confession several times The Global Gazette reported. 'I feel crazy and I know I'm not. I . think I have some form of ADD,' Crooks told the 911 operator. 'I tried . to rape her. I tried to rape her but I couldn't do it. 'Who tries to rape their own mom? My life is down the drain now.' As Michael placed a call to deputies . and sent an ambulance to the Crooks' home, Noah told him that his weapon . is empty and appeared concerned that the officers might shoot him. 'I just wish it was a dream so I could wake up and I could kiss her and hug her,' then-13-year-old Crooks said. Noah rambled on about his mother . making him homemade doughnuts earlier that night and expressed disbelief . that he killed her after she did that for him. He then revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his 'Call of Duty' video game because he got bad grades in . school, and that is when he snapped. 'Something just came over me,' he told the dispatcher. Weapon: A motive for the shooting has yet to be reported while the victim's husband, pictured, had a penchant for guns according to his Facebook page . The boy droned on about having to move . away and giving up on his dreams of getting into a good college and . marrying his eighth-grade girlfriend. On the first day of Crooks' trial . Wednesday, jurors also heard testimony from Mitchell County Sheriff’s . Deputies Jeff Huftalin and Greg Halbach, who described the crime scene . at 3599 Cameo Avenue, WCF Courier reported. Gretchen Crooks' bullet-riddled body . was found stretched out on a coach. Her pajama top was undone and she . was naked from the waist down, Halbach said in court. The woman was not . breathing. The deputies seized the murder weapon, a .22 caliber rifle, which was lying across a chair in the dining room. Halbach said that he slapped handcuffs . on Noah's wrists and placed him in the patrol car. He added that the . teenage suspect was not crying and did not appear emotional. Noah Crooks' attorney is not denying . that his client killed his mother, but he claims that the boy suffered . what he referred to as a 'tumor of rage, ‘rendering him insane at the . time of the slaying . Addressing the jury panel, the lawyer . said that a child psychiatrist will testify that Crooks suffers from . intermittent explosive disorder - a mental illness marked by repeated . episodes of impulsive, aggressive or violent behavior. Child's play: Noah revealed that his mother had taken away his 'Call of Duty' video game because he got bad grades in school, and that is when he snapped . On Friday, Noah's father, William Crooks, 41, testified that on the day of his wife's murder, he was at a going-away party for his boss when he got a text message from his son that read: 'Dad this is Noah. I killed Mom accidentally, I egret it. Come home now please.' Crooks was certain that his son was kidding and responded in kind: 'OK. Just throw her in the grove. We'll take care of her later.' About 20 minutes later, a sheriff's deputy called Mr Crooks and told him that he needed to come home because an accident had taken place. Crooks pulled up to the house at around 8.20pm on March 24. In court Friday, he described the scene inside his home as 'chaos.' The father explained o the jury that his was was the disciplinarian in the family, and had a stormy but loving relationship with their son. Mr Crooks added that the mother and son would fight often, but later make up and play games together. She was the one who bought the .22 caliber Ruger as a present for Noah in 2010 when he was about 11 years old. The father said that his son did once say that he wanted to kill his mother, but he didn't take the threat seriously. There was no history of domestic abuse or criminal records associated with any Crooks family members. On March 24, 2012, Crooks is believed to have fired a .22 caliber at his mother at their rural home. The teen was said to be calm and emotionless when he called 911 reporting the shooting. Home: Police reported the teenager as sounding calm on the phone though perhaps in shock by what had just happened . 'The emotions of the young man, from . what I've been told, is his demeanor was very calm and kind of stoic. Almost like he was in shock also,' Deputy Greg Beaver told KTTC at the time. Mitchell . County Sheriff Curt Younker told the DesMoines Register: 'We’re at a . loss. These are good people, very responsible. It is the most . heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen.' 'We have lost our daughter. We have lost . our grandson,' Mrs Crooks' mother Beverly Brahm of Mason City told the . Albert Lea Tribune. Mrs Crooks, who was listed with her husband William Crooks as the rural Osage property owners, had worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree after accepted at the University of Iowa in 2009. On her Facebook page back in 2010, she praised her son, one of two sons according to Mrs Brahm, for his musical talents on the saxophone as well as his accomplishment in being accepted into a University of Iowa camp to learn Chinese. 'So proud of him!' she wrote. She had also recently published an application on her page reading: 'Click ""like"" if you love your son!' Mrs Crooks' death comes as the first reported murder in the city of Osage since 1898, according to KAAL-TV. Praise: The mother had praised her son on her Facebook page for his acceptance into a Chinese language camp at the University of Iowa as well as his playing of the saxophone . Arrest: The 13-year-old was taken into custody without incident and taken to the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center where charges have not yet been filed . Speaking of her daughter with pride, . her mother, whom she relishes knowing she was able to say 'I love you' to . earlier in the day of her passing, described the 37-year-old as . studying 'full time, while she was working full time,' according to the . Courier.

John Guidetti, without a goal since November 30, and Leigh Griffiths, on Sunday charged by police for an alleged offence in an Edinburgh pub last year, both drew blanks while Commons always shaped up like the lock-breaker Celtic needed. Celtic's players celebrate Commons' strike from range landing in the back of the net . Celtic captain Scott Brown (right) attempts to score for Celtic against Ross County . Commons (right) was denied another goal in the late stages, despite taking the ball past Antonio Beguero (left) County boss Jim McIntyre was quick to learn his lesson from the 5-0 defeat doled out by Celtic in October when the champions were four goals up by the 34th minute. At Parkhead before the turn of the year he stifled Celtic in a stalemate and, for the third meeting in as many months, there would be no shame in trying the same tactics. Albeit minus Richie Brittain with a torn hamstring, County’s solid structure tested the patience and the probing of the visitors. Only when Scott Brown’s backheel flick to Emilio Izaguirre opened up an imaginative avenue to goal did Celtic threaten in the opening half hour. Commons, however, couldn’t keep his back-post header down from Izaguirre’s delivery. Deila pleads for his team to play at pace but, when confronted by a side detailed to throttle that ambition at source, Celtic often struggle to scheme at speed. The craft of Commons helped Celtic create more menace towards the end of the half. Scott Boyd, just as he’d done at Parkhead, was excellent in blocking shots at goal and he frustrated Commons here. Filip Kiss then conceded a free-kick on the edge of the area and Commons picked himself up to force Reguero into pushing away his dipping attempt. They were perhaps fortunate not to be chasing the game by that point. Izaguirre played the man, Craig Curran, at the back post instead of the ball that had pinged back and forth across Craig Gordon’s goal on the only occasion Celtic had to defend deep. Referee Kevin Clancy rejected those penalty claims. Gordon coughed up a Graham Carey drive but there were no takers and McIntyre’s complaint all day long would have been that his men didn’t counter with much belief after doing the right things when sitting off Celtic. Striker Leigh Griffiths reacts to missing a good chance to score for Celtic in the first half . Celtic manager Ronny Deila went over to celebrate with the Celtic fans after the full time whistle was blown . Liam Boyce, a late first-half replacement for the injured Tony Dingwall, led the County line after the break but the enforced adjustment had little time to take positive effect. Celtic were brisk on the break with Commons at the heart of a move that culminated in Reguero denying Griffiths and Jamie Reckord’s block stopping a strike from Guidetti on the follow-up. The on-loan Swede continues to drive his transfer price down. After netting 11 in his first 10 games, he went six appearances without a goal before Deila kept him benched throughout the back-to-back wins over Hamilton and Motherwell. Eligible to play against Inter Milan, Guidetti was salivating earlier in the season about that prospect and the dream of grabbing a hat-trick against Rangers. If he can string three starts together right now, that will be a surprise. Frustration boiled over as he squared up to Quinn near the end. At least that ended in a hug. Will that be an example for Peter Lawwell and Commons to follow over the club’s contract talks with their star man? It was no surprise that Commons was the spark for the winner. His speculative strike from 30 yards got the assistance his gamble required. After Commons let fly, Quinn turned his back and the connection from his calf took the ball on a looping passage over his helpless keeper and into the net. County have picked up just one point since their Parkhead heroics and, with Jake Jervis on for extra presence up top, only came close to snatching another on 80 minutes. Boyce cut inside Adam Matthews to whip a shot across goal and Gordon twice denied Boyd, but they had become daring too late in the day. At least that’s the ast McIntyre will see of Celtic this season, while their rivals still have the champions to contend with down the stretch of the relegation scrap.","It was goalless at half-time as Ross County frustrated Celtic in the first 45 .

His latest quest for freedom comes ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the death of the former Beatle, a British singer-songwriter who was gunned down outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980. Chapman is scheduled to be interviewed by two or three members of the parole board, according to Carole Claren-Weaver, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Corrections. Chapman's words on the slaying . He was last up for parole in 2010, but was denied because his ""discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,"" according to the New York State Division of Parole. He was also denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Chapman, 57, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, and is being held at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York. He is in protective custody in a single-person cell, Claren-Weaver said, and is allowed out three hours per day. Since his transfer from Attica earlier this year, Chapman has reapplied to participate in a state program called ""family reunion,"" which allows inmates to spend more time with family members. Chapman has not had an infraction since 1994. It is not clear if he currently has legal representation.

'She's very relaxed and is a filly that doesn't always show you much at home, reserving her best for the track.'

You might think that predicting the weather correctly is a fairly basic requirement for a forecaster. But at the Met Office, getting it right is apparently such a shock that its staff have had to be rewarded – with almost £1million in bonuses. Figures released today show forecasters have shared a huge windfall after they met accuracy targets for public forecasts and weather warnings last year. Met Office staff have been handed £1million in bonuses for meeting accuracy targets for public forecasts . The weathermen and women have, however, been accused of a series of high profile blunders in the past, leaving critics to question whether they really deserve a bonus for just doing their job. In total last year the Met Office handed staff £2.7million, with £942,000 of this given for meeting accuracy targets. This is the highest amount paid to staff in bonuses for correctly predicting the weather compared with each of the past five years. Forecasters achieved this with the aid of a new ‘supercomputer’, which costs £8million a year to help with predictions. The Met Office’s chief executive John Hirst was last year paid a total of £185,000, which included a bonus payment of £20,000 – although he took a voluntary pay cut in April last year when his contract was extended. Almost 2,000 staff at the organisation were also given a £346 bonus in their wages as a congratulations for hitting their weather forecast accuracy targets. Critics are unhappy that the Met Office (based in Exeter, above) is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more . Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Given the amount of times that the Met Office has been left with egg on its face it is time it stopped worrying about bonuses and focused on getting its forecasts right.’ Critics are also unhappy that the Met Office is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more. The 90-day forecasts were shortened to 30 days after the 2009 ‘barbecue summer’ fiasco. Jonathan Powell, of independent forecaster Positive Weather Solutions, said it was ‘totally irresponsible of the Met Office not to offer the public long-range forecasts in order not to be seen as getting it wrong’. The Met Office said it discontinued long range forecasts following research showing the public find shorter forecasts of more use. A Met Office spokesman added: ‘For the last financial year the Met Office met all of its forecast accuracy targets as our public forecasts and weather warnings helped the UK prepare for everything from London 2012, to the wettest year in a century, to widespread snowfall in January. ‘We are consistently ranked in the top two most accurate forecasters in the world by the World Meteorological Organisation and our forecast targets each year help us build on that world leading capability.’","Weathermen and women accused of a series of high profile blunders .

Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard pulled no punches as they admitted Liverpool deserve to be out of the Champions League. A dismal return to Europe’s premier competition ended as 10-man Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Basle at Anfield. They secured five points from their six games and are now condemned to the Europa League. Liverpool were poor for most of the game and deservedly trailed to Fabian Frei’s first half goal and their task looked forlorn when Lazar Markovic was sent off before Gerrard set up a grandstand finish with a free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-1 Basle . Steven Gerrard's free-kick gave Liverpool hope, but they couldn't find a second goal as they were eliminated . Gerrard admitted Liverpool have not been good enough during their Champions League campaign . They would have been fortunate to get through, however, and neither Rodgers or Gerrard were looking to make excuses. ‘The big game was away in Basle where we did not play well (and lost 1-0),’ said Rodgers. ‘We have no complaints. If you deserve to go through, you go through. We have not been good enough to go through. We have to take it on the chin. ‘When you don’t qualify everyone gets looked upon. We wanted to qualify. We have been analysed and for us the solution is we have to do better – manager and players – the expectancy was high but this is a different group of players and squad.’ Brendan Rodgers looks down in the dumps as Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League . Gerrard and Raheem Sterling look dejected after failing to qualify for the knockout stage . Gerrard added: ‘We haven't gone out of the competition because of our performance tonight, we've gone out because away at Basle we weren't good enough, in our last game we conceded a stupid goal towards injury time. ‘You always qualify over the six games and unfortunately we haven't been good enough. We need to get our main striker Daniel Sturridge back and get some more goals in the side. We need to get Mario Balotelli back and firing. ‘That is not to take away anything from the lads who have played tonight and have slogged their guts out. Rickie Lambert has ran himself into the ground tonight, but it has just been a game too far tonight and that has been because of a lack of numbers.’ Substitute Lazar Markovic saw red for aiming a flailing arm at Basle's Behrang Safari . It could be that Liverpool’s best hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season is to win the Europa League. Rodgers has vowed to take the competition seriously. Rodgers, who felt the red card for Markovic was a 'really, really poor' decision, added: ‘We want to do our best in the tournament. It is something we have to fight to do and something we will. ‘Of course it is managing expectation we have been out a long time and came in with a lot excitement and wanted to do well. 'There will be disappointment tonight because we did not qualify but now we have to look to the rest of the season and make it a success and then at the end everyone will look at it and see where it is at.’","Liverpool failed to qualify for the last 16 after being held to draw by Basle .

A woman who was warned her boyfriend would completely lose his memory after a serious car crash was astounded when he awoke from a coma and said: 'I don’t know who you are, I don’t know your name, but I love you.' Chrissy Fryett was told to expect the worst when her partner Stewart was injured in a horror car crash in Stockton-on-Tees. Medics warned her that if the 39-year-old did survive, he would never recognise her again. But despite the odds Mr Fryett did survive, regained his memory and the couple, now married, have celebrated the birth of their first child together. Chrissy Fryett, from Stockton, Teesside, who was warned that her partner Stewart would not remember her after he suffered a serious brain injury. The couple have since celebrated the birth of their first child together . Mrs Fryett was warned her then boyfriend would completely lose his memory after a serious car crash, but was astounded when he awoke from a coma and said: 'I don't know who you are, I don't know your name, but I love you.' The couple have since married . The former painter had suffered a severe brain injury, broken ribs, collapsed lungs and shattered spine when a car he was a passenger in spun out of control and hit an oncoming vehicle. When he woke up after 10 days in a coma, he declared his love for his now wife, 32, who had kept a bedside vigil for him. For the next three months, Mrs Fryett helped her husband regain his memory of their relationship before the accident - to the amazement of medics who warned he may never happen. Mrs Fryett, from Ingleby Barwick in Stockton-On-Tees, said: 'I cried when he said those words to me, and will never forget it. 'I was determined I wasn’t going to lose him. We had only met six months earlier, but we had fallen in love. 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw him trapped in the car, there was nothing I could do. The love of my life was slipping away from me. 'In those first weeks I spent hours talking to him about all the times we had spent together. 'We had planned our future before the crash, and I just prayed he would remember what we had.' In 2009 the  father of six, was a passenger in a family friend’s new Ford Focus RS when the car hit a curb and collided with an oncoming car in Ingleby Barwick, near Middlesbrough, only 200 yards from where they had set off. He spent almost three months at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Mrs Fryett helped her husband regain his memory of their relationship before the accident - to the amazement of medics who warned it may never happen. The couple pictured shortly after they first met . Mrs Fryett said during this time his memory was incredibly sketchy and jumbled, with him not having any sense of time. She would ask him what car he drove, and he would mention one from ten years ago. 'I told him about our first date. He would remember for an instant, but then forget straight away. 'One day I brought photographs in of us at a wedding we had gone to. '""Remember"",’ I said, ""We got really drunk and felt awful the next day!"" Mr Fryett still has problems with short term memory and suffers from severe sleep apnea. He requires a high level of care and was awarded compensation for the accident in February this year . 'Stuart began to laugh, and slowly things started to come back to him.' Eventually the memories began to stick, and at Christmas that year Mr Fryett proposed. In 2012 the couple got married, and just over two weeks ago Mrs Fryett gave birth to Oliver, their first child together. She said: 'Oliver is a dream. He is just amazing. 'It was the final piece to the puzzle and now we are complete. 'He has just fitted into our little lives perfectly.” 'Stewart has five other children from before we met and they have adapted brilliantly to their dad’s situation.'

Police have searched the home of disgraced former Co-operative Bank chairman Paul Flowers as they investigate drugs offences. West . Yorkshire Police is probing him after he was filmed allegedly buying crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. The Methodist minister led the bank for three years, which lost £700million while he was apparently taking drugs and setting up sex sessions with rent boys. In 1981 he was convicted of gross . indecency after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a . trucker in a public toilet - but he was forgiven by the church. He . also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after . 'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he . used, the city council said. Police in Yorkshire have admitted they had raided his home. 'Officers executed a search warrant at an . address in Great Horton, (Bradford) as part . of an investigation into alleged drugs offences,'  a spokesman for the force. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing growing . questions over his party's links to the former bank chairman, who has . also been accused of incompetence. Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal. Mr Wardle brought forward his plans to retire by six months, acknowledging that he led the board that had appointed Mr Flowers. Raid: Officers last night entered the home of Rev Flowers with a forensic team after the Mail on Sunday revealed the scale of his drug taking . Investigation: West Yorkshire Police back at the home of disgraced bank boss Paul Flowers today after more revelations about his life . Tory . chairman Grant Shapps has now demanded to know when Mr Miliband and . shadow chancellor Ed Balls were aware that Mr Flowers resigned as a . councillor in Bradford after adult material was found on his computer. In . a letter, Mr Shapps challenged the Labour leader to give details of . private meetings with Mr Flowers, explain why he had been brought on to . the party's business advisory group, and return a £50,000 donation to Mr . Balls' office that he had backed. 'Will you instruct your MPs not to . accept any more money from the Co-operative Group until the current . investigation is resolved?' Mr Shapps insisted. Labour has said Mr . Flowers was 'neither influential nor important' and the 63-year-old has . been suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute. A . source said: 'It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in . March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings . that we can find records of in the space of three years. 'This shows that Mr Flowers was neither influential nor important.' Mr Flowers lives in a modest house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 . During . an appearance before the Commons Treasury committee earlier this month, . where Mr Flowers stumbled over the basic facts and figures relating to . the ailing bank, he was pressed on whether he had approved a £50,000 . donation to Mr Balls' from the Co-operative Group in 2011/2012 while a . member of the board. Ciaron Dodd said Paul Flowers was debauched and 'showered him with gifts' 'My recollection is that we paid for a . particular researcher to assist the shadow chancellor in the work that . he needed to do, and that we believed to be a legitimate and proper use . of resources,' he replied. A spokesman for Mr Balls said: 'The Co-op . Group, not the bank, donated £50,000 to the shadow chancellor's office . which was declared in the normal way at the time. 'Ed has never . discussed the donation with Paul Flowers. Ed's been to a few events . which Rev Flowers has also been at, but he's never had a meeting or . phone conversation with him.' Last nigh the humiliation of Paul Flowers worsened when a rent boy claimed the ousted Co-op chief hired him for sex. Ciaron Dodd, 21, said they met in plush hotel rooms paid for by the struggling bank. The . Methodist minister, who was forced to quit his £130,000 role in June, . showered him with gifts and took him for nights out to the theatre, said . Mr Dodd. The explosive allegations came as the Labour Party faced further damaging questions about its links with Flowers. Pictures . have emerged of a lavish reception hosted by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls at 10 . Downing Street for Flowers and fellow Co-op grandees while . Labour was in power. It also emerged that Labour knew two . years ago that Flowers had been forced to resign as one of the party’s . city councillors after gay porn was found on his computer. But . it appears the Co-op was not told – allowing him to continue until June . as its banking chairman, a position from which he helped to approve . massive donations to Labour and Mr Balls. Dodd, a £650-a-night escort, has backed up his claim by producing . damning messages sent by Flowers, 63, from his work email - in . which he organises drug-fuelled threesomes. Dodd said: ‘I knew what he did for a living and couldn’t believe how debauched he was. ‘Every time he saw me he knew he was risking everything – but he just didn’t seem to care. ‘He . took me to the theatre and gave me presents like chocolate and wine. I . was old enough to be his grandson but he didn’t seem to think we looked . like the odd couple.’ Prime Minister David Cameron today joked that a senior Labour MP took 'mind-altering substances' during a night out with a former bank chairman who was filmed allegedly using illegal drugs. Mr Cameron made the gag at Prime Minister's Questions after former environment minister Michael Meacher claimed inward investment to the United Kingdom was lower than in a number of Third World countries. The Prime Minister retorted Mr Meacher must have been on a night out with Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the Co-operative Bank for three years, who was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. Question: The Prime Minister offended Labour's  Michael Meacher today when he asked about investment and Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers . In a question to Mr Cameron, the MP for Oldham West and Royton said: 'Are you aware that according to the Economist, Britain is now 159th lowest in the world in terms of business investment, just behind Mali, Paraguay and Guatemala. 'Can you tell the House that when, under your esteemed leadership and that of the Chancellor, Britain can expect to catch up with Mali?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers (right) and that mind-altering substances have taken effect. 'The fact is that in the first six months of this year, Britain has received more inward investment than in any other country anywhere in the world.' The joke angered Mr Meacher, who raised a point of order at the end of Prime Minister's Questions. Turning to Speaker John Bercow, he said: 'As you would have heard, and as everyone else in the House heard, I raised a perfectly reasonable question, which was based on clear evidence as I indicated. 'Is it parliamentary for the Prime Minister to respond by accusing (me) of sounding as if (I) had been taking mind-altering substances? I want to ask whether it is parliamentary to use such an unjustifiable, rude and offensive phrase?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I completely respect you and the important question you asked which I tried to answer with the point about inward investment in to Britain. 'I made a light-hearted remark. If it caused any offence, then I will happily withdraw it. I think it is very important that we can have a little bit of light-hearted banter and a sense of humour on all sides.' Earlier, Mr Cameron said that Chancellor George Osborne is to have talks with financial regulators on a possible inquiry into the troubles of the bank. Mr Cameron told the House of Commons that there were 'a lot of questions that have to be answered' about the appointment of former bank chairman Mr Flowers. West Yorkshire Police have searched the home of Mr Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal, which came after the ailing bank had to be bailed out by hedge funds after getting into financial difficulties. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: 'The Chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong here. 'But there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Rev Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren't alarm bells ringing earlier?'","Reverend Paul Flowers filmed trying to buy crack cocaine and crystal meth .

0170f15f7bda5e1972ad86d4923c81a0851fe7c3,"The Conservatives will need to slash £21 billion from the welfare budget after the election because the pensions bill keeps rising, experts warned last night. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Tory spending plans suggest post-election cuts to Britain’s bloated benefits bill will have to be far deeper than those imposed since 2010. In a major new study, the respected think-tank said a £7 billion reduction in working age benefits since 2010 had been cancelled out by a £7 billion rise in the pensions bill. George Osborne will have to cut £21billion off the benefits bill after the next election in order to stick to his spending plans . As a result, the £220 billion welfare bill is ‘virtually unchanged’, it says. But the IFS said the bill would have been £16.7 billion higher without changes introduced by the Coalition. David Cameron has said the Conservatives will impose £12 billion of welfare cuts after the election, including cutting the benefits cap from £26,000 to £23,000. But the IFS said reductions of £21 billion – almost double the amount announced so far – will be needed by 2020 if the Tories are to stick to their plan of cutting other Government spending at the same rate as that seen since 2010. It said the biggest cuts to the benefits system were ‘yet to come’. The report said that cutting another £21 billion from welfare would require a 23 per cent reduction in working-age benefits if the Tories continue to protect pensioners from the austerity drive. The Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson has exposed the scale of Government cuts required to balance the books after the next election . And the think-tank warned that if future governments keep Mr Cameron’s ‘triple lock’, under which the basic State pension rises in line with whichever is highest – inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent – it will result in support for the elderly growing faster than earnings and prices in the long term, at a cost of many billions of pounds a year. The basic State pension will already be costing £1.1 billion more by 2015/16 than if it was linked to inflation and £4.6 billion more than if it was linked to earnings, it found. ‘Growing pensioner numbers and higher entitlements among new pensioners have pushed up real-terms spending on the state pension by £12 billion between 2010/11 and 2015/16,’ the report said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves criticised the Government's failure to reduce welfare spending . ‘This has been partially offset by falls in spending on other benefits for pensioners, leaving overall spending on benefits for pensioners £7 billion higher. In contrast, spending on benefits for working-age adults and for children has fallen by around £7 billion.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith last night highlighted figures in the report showing a sharp fall in out-of-work benefits. Spending on Jobseekers’ Allowance is due to fall from £8.5 billion in 2010 to £5.2 billion this year. The £3.3 billion reduction is enough to fund the employment of more than 120,000 nurses. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Our welfare reforms – as part of our long-term economic plan – are getting more people off benefits and into work. That means more people waking up every morning with the security of a regular wage and a chance of a better future for themselves and their family. ‘Not only that, it’s cutting the benefits bill too, meaning we can get the deficit down so our economy is stronger and more secure.’ The new report also found there was evidence that tougher sanctions have had ‘some success’ in encouraging claimants to return to work, particularly single parents. But Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said the Government had failed to reduce the welfare bill despite imposing ‘cruel and unfair’ cuts.","The Chancellor will have to cut working-age benefits by 23% after election .

Rashmi Patel, 45, of Suffield, turned himself in Tuesday at the Enfield Police Department and was charged with a misdemeanor count of criminally negligent homicide and a felony count of tampering with evidence, police said. Patel has offices in Enfield and Torrington. The charges came exactly one year after Patel's patient, 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington, died in hospital on February 17, 2014. Charged: Rashmi Patel, 45, turned himself in to police Tuesday night on a warrant for his arrest, one year after the death of his patient, Judith Gan, 64, who flat-lined in his dentist chair during a marathon operation . Going to trial: Dentist Rashmi Patel, center, sits at a hearing of the Connecticut State Dental Commission in Hartford on Wednesday, December 17, 2014. He has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide . State dental regulators concluded that Patel failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low when she was consciously sedated in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in Patel's Enfield office the same day. Patel, who posted $25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. He and his attorney didn't return messages Wednesday. Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a monthslong review of his practice and permanently ban him from performing conscious sedation. The commission said in a report that Patel 'ignored' signs that Gan was in distress, including the drop in her oxygen saturation, changes in the color of her face and hands, and wheezing and gurgling sounds. Scene: Gan went into distress and later flat-lined during a complex procedure at Dr. Patel's Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut. She had a complex history of medical issues that Patel was aware of . The commission said Patel also ignored warnings from his dental assistants that Gan was in danger and continued on with the procedures. The assistants told Patel to stop operating, but he pressed ahead. When one of the assistants yelled that Gan was 'flat lining,' Patel tried to revive Gan while the assistant called 911, according to the Dental Commission's report. Judith Gan, 64, died suddenly on February 17, 2014 . Gan was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit, given that her extensive medical history. Gan had suffered a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the last two years, and the medication she was on could have affected her response to the sedation. Patel was aware of Gan's medical issues. Patel also violated care standards in December 2013, when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a throat pack, which was designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. The patient began flailing, his blood pressure spiked and he was rushed to a hospital but recovered. A lawyer for Gan's husband has said a lawsuit against Patel is planned. Patel was also sued for malpractice in 2009 for 'shoddy' dental work, according to The New York Daily News. The victim, Doreen Jasonis, won $500,000 from a jury before Patel appealed and settled out of court. Banned: Patel’s license, which was issued in 2003, was suspended in April. In December, the board banned him from treating patients under sedation .","Judy Gan, 64, lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted on February 17, 2014 .

Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout fund this week, the main opposition leader said today -just one day after parliament rejected the proposal, causing the government to fall. Robert Fico, head of Smer-Social Democracy, said that in exchange for his party's votes, three outgoing government party leaders have agreed to hold early general elections on March 10. He said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest,' Collapsed: In a desperate effort to force a vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta Radicova tied it to a confidence vote - the one-year-old government subsequently collapsed . Tuesday's vote on the bail out failed because a junior coalition party, the Freedom and Solidarity party, was against it. In a desperate effort to force that . party to vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta . Radicova tied the vote to a confidence vote - but it failed causing her one-year-old government to collapse. With the government defunct - and . with the promise of early elections - Fico said his party will now vote . in favour of the bailout fund, which all 16 other members of the . eurozone have already supported. The leaders of three coalition parties . - Mikulas Dzurinda of the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, which . Radicova belongs to; Jan Figel of the Christian Democrats and Bela Bugar . of a party of ethnic Hungarians - confirmed the deal. Bugar said. 'We had to pay a political price. And the early election is the price.' Just one day after parliament rejected the proposal causing the government to fall, Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout . Opposition party leader, and former prime minister, Robert Fico said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest' The announcement came hours after EU . President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose . Manuel Barroso called on Slovak political parties 'to rise above the . positioning of short-term politics, and seize the next occasion to . ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.' They said the enhancement of the . €44billion Euro European Financial Stability Facility is crucial 'to . preserve financial stability in the euro area. And that is in the . interest of all euro countries, including the Slovak people.' Eurozone leaders had agreed in July to . increase the size and powers of the bailout fund, giving it the ability . to lend quickly to governments in case of market trouble in order to . contain the stubborn financial crisis. Fico's populist leftist party is by . far the strongest political force in Slovakia and stands a good chance . to win the early ballot. It won last year's general elections in June . with 34.8 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 150-seat . Parliament. The senior party of the outgoing . coalition, the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, was well behind in . second, with 15.4 percent, or 28 seats. Fico's party campaigned on a promise . to maintain the country's welfare state even as other European countries . slash their budgets to deal with the economic crisis. During his term of prime minister . between 2006 and 2010, Slovakia adopted the euro currency in 2009. Despite him taking the largest share of the vote in the 2010 election, . four opposition parties with a majority of 79 parliamentary seats agreed . to form a ruling coalition. Mr Fico and his party had always . supported expanding the fund expansion in principle, but had said it . would vote 'yes' only if the government agreed to call early elections. As major eurozone policies need the . approval of all 17 countries that use the currency, Slovakia's vote - . the last - carried immense weight. For . weeks it appeared certain it would reject boosting the bailout fund, . unnerving financial markets and threatening the future of Europe's plans . to fight the crisis. Experts . said EU officials could possibly find a way around a Slovakian . rejection of the bill to boost the powers and size of the bailout fund, . the European Financial Stability Facility (ESFS), but that doing so . would carry costs to European unity. In . the longer-term, the drama seems sure to add momentum to the push for . nimbler rules to govern the 17-country eurozone, where government . reaction to the unfolding crisis has seemed for many months to be behind . the curve. That push has been gathering momentum for some time. Charts key economic data for Greece . In August, the leaders of France and Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, proposed that the heads of the eurozone countries elect the president of a new 'economic government' who would direct regular summits to respond to the continent's financial crisis. And in September Jose Manuel Barroso. president of the European Commission, decried what he called 'the constraint of unanimity'. Mr Barroso told the European Parliament: 'The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest.' At issue now is an agreement reached by the eurozone leaders in July to enlarge the EFSF's capital guarantee from 440billion to 780billion euro. Slovakia would contribute about 1 per cent, or 7.7billion euro. In addition, if the changes are approved, the facility would have new powers and able to prop up government bond markets and help put new capital reserves against losses in banks. Although 16 countries have given the thumbs-up, approval of the changes has found itself in potential jeopardy because of the opposition of a junior member of Slovakia's governing coalition, the Freedom and Solidarity Party.

0177e011302ec1925adb4cd77a026577fd8206dd,"David Cameron must shoulder some of the blame for Mark Reckless's defection, after falling out with him over the issue of Europe . During the run-up to last week’s Ukip conference, Nigel Farage was spotted going into an elegant Georgian townhouse close to a former site of the Bedlam hospital, one of the first British mental institutions, where the gentry used to amuse themselves by laughing at the inmates. Mark Reckless, a bespectacled 6ft 3in economist and barrister who became a Tory MP at the last election, arrived around the same time. It was in the privacy of the £2 million house that they plotted their own modern-day public spectacle: the humiliation of David Cameron on the eve of the Tory Party conference. The house is owned by Malcolm Pearson, who has a 12,000-acre estate in the west of Scotland, who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher shortly before she was bundled unceremoniously from office. As Lord Pearson of Rannoch he was always on the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party. It was his membership of the Lords EU select committee, from 1992 to 1996, which led him to become a leading exponent of the case for the UK to leave the EU. In 2004, in despair at the Tory stance on Europe, he recommended people voted Ukip in the European elections, and was swiftly punished by having the Tory whip removed. He joined Ukip three years later. He made good use of his time on the Ukip side, becoming firm friends with Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, and the first Tory MP in the current Parliament to defect to Ukip. Carswell is a close friend of Reckless. They often met for drinks at Pearson’s home as they toyed with the idea of joining Ukip. But while Carswell, an MP since 2005, is a popular figure on the Tory benches, the same is not true of Reckless, who is regarded as cold and aloof. Carswell is one of his few confidantes at Westminster. With the Clacton by-election looming on October 9, dozens of Tory MPs have discovered pressing alternative engagements when asked to go to the Essex seaside town to campaign against Carswell. But there is real anger among Tory MPs about Reckless, not least because he was lying about his intentions only hours before his bombshell announcement. So why did Reckless decide to jump? The truth is David Cameron has much to answer for. His sometimes casual attitude to party management has repeatedly alienated some MPs. If any of them criticise him privately or publicly, they can find themselves sent to the political equivalent of Siberia. In the run-up to last week's Ukip conference, Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless were spotted going into a £2million townhouse in London together . In the summer of 2013, Cameron led an away-day of Tory MPs in his Chipping Norton constituency in Oxfordshire. It was designed to foster team spirit and develop election-winning policies. Unfortunately, by the end of the gathering, the Prime Minister’s already fractious relationship with Mark Reckless had disintegrated. In a speech during that event, the PM stressed the importance of unity. Sarah Wollaston, the former GP who became MP for Totnes at the last election, interrupted to say her constituents admired her independent-minded stances on several issues. After the session ended, Cameron sought out Wollaston and said: ‘Well, Sarah, you have to understand that when you rebel you never change anything. You just make us look divided.’ Reckless, who was sitting next to Wollaston, intervened, reminding the PM the only reason Cameron cut Britain’s EU grant was because of a revolt in 2012 by Tory MPs. The PM snapped back, saying: ‘I would have cut that anyhow.’ A disagreement ensued, and Reckless’s draining ‘faith’ in the PM evaporated. In June this year, Reckless – who studied PPE at Oxford and was privately educated at Marlborough College – was the first MP to be called to speak at a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee of MPs which was addressed by Cameron. He challenged the Prime Minister over his promised renegotiation of powers from the EU ahead of a referendum in 2017 if the Tories win the General Election. Cameron is said to have been dismissive of Reckless, who concluded that the promised renegotiation was a PR stunt. The Ukip timebomb which had started ticking away the previous year was by then on a very short fuse. The first approach from Ukip to Reckless – a former economist who married Scottish solicitor Catriona Brown at Westminster Cathedral in 2011 – came from Stuart Wheeler, the spread-betting magnate who gave £5 million to the Tories in 2001 when they were committed to keeping the pound. Lord Pearson was a former Tory MP, but defected to Ukip in 2007. He also led the party for a short time . Wheeler was thrown out of the Tories in 2009 when he gave £100,000 to Ukip, which he subsequently joined. He entertained Reckless twice at Serafino – an Italian restaurant a short walk from Wheeler’s home. It was after the Wheeler lunches that Reckless got to know Farage much better. But the decisive factor in the defection of Reckless was Lord Pearson. The founder of a London-based insurance brokers, which he sold for millions in the 1990s, Pearson owns a moor, a deer forest, and a £4 million 12,000-acre country estate in Rannoch in the Highlands. He has a share portfolio worth a reputed £2.5 million. With his cut-glass accent, a legacy of his Eton education, Pearson, 72, looks and sounds like an archetypal Tory grandee. He became the leader of Ukip after Farage stood down to fight a parliamentary seat at the 2010 election. One of his first acts was to withdraw candidates in elections against four prominent Tory Eurosceptic MPs. He forced the policy through in the teeth of bitter opposition from within Ukip’s ranks. The candidates were Philip Davies, who was defending Shipley, which he won last time with a 10,000 majority, and Philip Hollobone in Kettering, which he held with a 9,000 majority. And the other two candidates? Step forward Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. Pearson also flooded their constituencies with 50,000 Ukip leaflets, urging votes to support the Tory candidates. All four enjoyed greater swings in their favour than in other constituencies. Given that two of the four Tories he backed at the last election have since defected, Pearson admits: ‘I always thought it was the right thing to do.’ And what about the other two, Davies and Hollobone? ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he says. Which is exactly what he said about Carswell and Reckless. How the Tories must regret the offer from Farage and Pearson to stand down every one of their candidates at the last general election if Mr Cameron would make an unequivocal declaration in favour of an EU referendum. Pearson made the offer in June 2009 to Lord Strathclyde, the then Tory leader in the House of Lords, who conveyed it to Cameron. The Tory leader rejected it out of hand. Given the events of the weekend, no wonder Tory MPs and strategists are terrified another Ukip defector is about to lob a political hand grenade into the Conservative conference hall.","Farage met Reckless before Ukip conference in house of Malcolm Pearson .

0179773e5a0acce1c05218d797138f9f03af46c7,"(CNN) -- Rough seas are delaying the connection of the vessel Helix Producer to the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman at the oil cleanup command center in Louisiana said Wednesday. The linkup ""may be in place by Saturday,"" he said. Officials have said that the hookup is partially completed despite the bad weather, but once it is done it could draw up to 53,000 barrels of oil a day. But Charles Gaiennie of the Unified Command's Joint Information Center in Houma, Louisiana, says the current ""sea state"" is delaying the operation and that many Louisiana cleanup activities, such as skimming and flights delivering aerial dispersants, have been ""stood down"" because of the rough weather. He said that if there's is ""a window of opportunity to deploy [resources], we will do so."" Newly retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told reporters Wednesday it will be 24 to 48 hours before the sea calms enough to finish the linkup. Allen also told reporters that relief wells must be drilled an estimated 200 to 225 feet farther before they intercept the leaking well bore. He said that officials still expect that the relief wells will not be completed until August. Meanwhile, the number of cleanup workers reporting adverse health effects continues to rise. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down Wednesday for an exclusive interview with the man in charge of BP's medical response, Dr. Kevin O'Shea. He said more than 1,500 workers have sought medical care through BP, a significant increase from previously reported numbers. On Wednesday, the advocacy group ""Alliance for Justice"" released a report on oil industry ties among 5th Circuit Judges.  The report comes ahead of oral arguments set to begin Thursday in Hornbeck Offshore Services v. Salazar, the case that challenged the Obama administration's six-month ban on deep-water drilling. AJR's 9-page report claims that many Appellate Court judges have extensive ties to the oil industry, including Jerry Edwin Smith, William Eugene Davis and James L. Dennis, the three judges who will hear the administration's appeal of the drilling moratorium. The group also says District Judge Martin Feldman, who issued the order prohibiting the drilling moratorium, has financial interests in oil drilling companies. Oral arguments for Hornbeck v. Salazar will begin Thursday afternoon at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Meanwhile, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindall joined Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu on a flyover of affected areas, including the barrier islands, Port Fouchan, Grand Isle and the Mississippi River. The tour lasted about 90 minutes. And in Mississippi, state authorities report that they've received eight of the nine skimmers produced in France. Officials have closed more beaches in Hancock County and continue to press cleanup efforts. Officials say 550 bags -- amounting to 8,250 pounds of oil-related debris -- have been cleaned from a mile-long stretch of beach in Waveland. Federal estimates say between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels (about 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf daily since April 22, when the Deepwater Horizon sank two days after an explosion aboard the drilling rig. In early June, during an exclusive 48-hour embed with Allen, CNN's Kyra Phillips visited the site of the oil disaster and gained access to the Development Driller III -- the rig that is drilling the primary relief well some 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the sea floor. ""The intention is to intercept the well bore, well down below the surface near the reservoir, then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up,"" Allen said. ""That will allow them to basically plug or kill the well. Once that's done, you could do things like remove the blowout preventer, bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened."" Also, a massive airship, or blimp, and a sea vessel that can suck oil out of the ruptured well are expected to arrive in the Gulf region at the end of the week to aid in oil disaster response efforts. Their arrival is being delayed because of rough weather, said Stephanie Hebert, spokeswoman for the cleanup effort. The U.S. Navy airship will be used to detect oil, direct skimming ships and look for wildlife that may be threatened by oil, the Coast Guard says. It had been scheduled to reach the Gulf on Tuesday. The 178-foot-long blimp, known as the MZ-3A, can carry a crew of up to 10. It will fly slowly over the region to track where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore. The Navy says the advantage of the blimp over current helicopter surveillance operations is that it can stay aloft longer, with lower fuel costs, and can survey a wider area. The Coast Guard has already been pinpointing traveling pools of oil from the sky. ""The aircraft get on top of the oil. They can identify what type of oil it is and they can vector in the skimmer vessels right to the spot,"" Coast Guard Capt. Brian Kelley said. But the problem since June 30 has been the ability to clean it up before it approaches land. Bad weather has made that task more difficult. Fears over the spill now extend all the way to Florida's Atlantic shores. Small tar balls continued to wash ashore Wednesday at Cocoa Beach, just south of Cape Canaveral. The U.S. Coast Guard collected samples that will be tested for any connection to BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to Brevard County spokeswoman Kimberly Prosser. Tar balls that washed ashore two weeks ago were not found to be connected to BP's oil spill, she said. Officials told CNN the test results from the samples collected would not be available for seven to 10 days. Meanwhile, Bob Grantham, spokesman for TMT Offshore Group, said progress has been made in testing the company's A Whale oil skimmer, the world's largest. The delay from high seas ""has allowed us to make valuable observations and to develop some additional technological innovations designed to improve the channeling of oily water into the ship's large capacity tanks,"" Grantham said in a statement issued Tuesday. ""Over the next few days, we will have our first real opportunity to test the new technology under conditions that we hope will maximize the effectiveness of collection and ultimately decanting."" Earlier, officials said A Whale's abilities so far are ""inconclusive,"" meaning the massive converted oil tanker -- which is 3.5 football fields long -- has yet to prove its Taiwanese owner's claim that it can skim between 15,000 and 50,000 barrels of oil off the sea in a day. The Coast Guard said the testing period for the A Whale has been extended through Thursday. Meanwhile, interfaith leaders prayed for restoration and renewal for the Gulf of Mexico as they prepared for a tour of the oil-soaked marshes, wetlands and rookeries of the Louisiana coast Wednesday. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim clergy joined ""in prayer and commitment to the communities most affected by the BP oil disaster,"" Tuesday night, a Sierra Club statement said. Wives of current and former major league baseball players also fanned out across southern Louisiana to draw attention to the people and creatures affected by the disaster. The members of the Baseball Wives Charitable Foundation -- many of them from the Gulf -- toured beaches hit by oil and spoke with fishing and oil industry workers in Grand Isle on Tuesday . ""The initial point of this trip was to raise awareness,"" said Megan Thomas, wife of ex-big league slugger Frank Thomas.  ""We want to take things we've seen here firsthand home with us and create our own fundraisers and keep the awareness out there."" Jamie Buehrle, wife of Chicago White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle, said she was struck by Gulf residents who now fear their finances are in ruins. ""Just seeing the people today who are so scared of the unknown,"" Buehrle said.  ""Not knowing if they are going to get another check, if they are going to work again."" The wives will attend a minor league baseball game between the New Orleans Zephyrs and the Omaha Royals on Wednesday. The team is selling discount tickets for $5 for fishing industry workers and others affected by the disaster. Jessica Maholm, wife of Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Maholm, is from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. ""This (oil disaster) is something that's not going to affect just the Gulf coastal areas,"" she said. ""It's going to affect the whole country with the seafood, the animals and the ecosystem.""

017c35cb30a2a648994225c5c4d1f7014e9c1682,"(CNN) -- Ousted Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali was sentenced Monday to 15 and a half years in prison on charges related to the alleged discovery of weapons, archaeological artifacts and illegal drugs -- including marijuana -- in his country's presidential palace. Ben Ali's one-day trial and sentencing were conducted in absentia. The former strongman and his wife, Leila Trabelsi, have been living in exile in Saudi Arabia since the January revolt that ended his 23-year rule and touched off a wave of uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. Both Ben Ali and Trabelsi were sentenced last month to 35 years in prison on corruption charges. In addition to the prison term, the court imposed a fine of 91 million dinars ($65 million). Ben Ali and members of his inner circle are also facing a series of charges relating to alleged murder and torture. Those charges have been referred to a Tunisian military court, according to the state news agency TAP. Monday's trial -- initially scheduled to begin Thursday -- was held in a packed courtroom in Tunis. Hosni Beji, one of the lawyers representing Ben Ali, earlier asked the presiding judge, Touhami Hafi, to postpone the trial in part to give him time to persuade the former ruler to return to Tunisia. Beji said he is planning to meet Ben Ali in Saudi Arabia on Friday. Beji's request, which was refused, triggered a series of angry outbursts from other people in the courtroom. Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia since 1987. Protests began to erupt in December after the self-immolation of a fruit vendor whose cart had been seized by police. The vendor's fiery suicide touched off a firestorm among Tunisians fed up with corruption, high unemployment and escalating food prices. The revolt that followed left at least 300 people dead and 700 wounded, a United Nations human rights expert recently said. The former strongman's political party has since been dissolved by a court order, and parliamentary elections have been scheduled for this month. Ben Ali argued in June that he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. In a written statement released by one of his attorneys, Ben Ali said he was ""tired of being made a scapegoat"" and is a victim of ""injustice."" The former leader said that searches of his official and personal offices were ""merely stage dressing"" meant to discredit him. Contrary to the assertions of his opponents, Ben Ali argued that he worked for what he thought ""was the good of the Tunisian people, improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity.""
