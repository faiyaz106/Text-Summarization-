# Text-Summarization-
Text summarization is the process of extracting important details from a text document. It is used to produce a succinct summary of the document, and this can be done in one of two ways depending on output: either by extraction or abstraction. The extractive approaches concentrate on choosing a group of words or phrases from the source text to produce the summary. In this work, I have implemented the extractive summary based on Standard TF-IDF based, and Centroid based summarization to summarize the text from an article from multiple newspaper articles.

In this project, we have applied two type of extractive text summarization technique:
1. Frequency based: 
     * TF-IDF Based 
     * Centroid Based (Consine Similarity)
2. Graph Based: 
     * Text Rank (Based on concept of Page Rank undirected graph)
