# Text-Summarization-
Text summarization is the process of extracting important details from a text document. It is used to produce a succinct summary of the document, and this can be done in one of two ways depending on output: either by extraction or abstraction. One of the key methods in the field of text summarization is keyword extraction. The extractive approaches concentrate on choosing a group of words or phrases from the source text to produce the summary. In this work, we implemented four approaches - Standard TF-IDF based sentence ranking, Luhnâ€™s algorithm, and Centroid based summarization to extract keywords automatically and then summarize the text from an article from multiple newspaper articles. The fourth approach is the TextRank algorithm which is a graph-based summarization based on the PageRank algorithm. Finally, we performed a comparative analysis of all the methods. Centroid based summarization performs better compared to the other three algorithms.

In this project, we have applied two type of extractive text summarization technique:
1. Frequency based: 
     * TF-IDF Based 
     * Centroid Based (Consine Similarity)
     * Luhn's Method
2. Graph Based: 
     * Text Rank (Based on concept of Page Rank undirected graph)
